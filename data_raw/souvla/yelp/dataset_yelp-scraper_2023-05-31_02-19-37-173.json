      "text": "Upon arriving with my partner, we were pleasantly surprised to discover that this spot was a full-service restaurant, as we had only heard of it for their frozen yogurt. Despite this, the overwhelming number of positive reviews for their Bakkalava Frozen Yogurt piqued our curiosity and we were thrilled to finally try it during our visit to the city.\n\nBaklava is a Greek dessert consisting of layers of nuts, honey, and phyllo dough. Having it alone was undeniably sweet, but when paired with the neutral frozen yogurt, is a match made in heaven. The yogurt itself was unparalleled in its taste and texture, featuring a distinct Greek yogurt aroma and a thick, creamy consistency. Truly such a unique dessert that cannot be found elsewhere.\n\nAlthough I reside an hour away from the city, I will undoubtedly return in the summer to indulge in this delectable treat once more. In fact, I'd probably order one whole cup for myself rather than sharing it with my partner :')",

      "text": "Just moved to the city and this was one of the first restaurants a local told us to try out! We've now had it twice in the matter of a week. \n\nOverall I'll give it 3.5 stars. Chicken was the clear winner here!\n\n5/5 - Chicken Salad (Extra $1 for greek style w/ fries!)\n5/5 - Chicken Wrap \n5/5 - Fries\n5/5 - Baklava yogurt \n\n3/5 - Juicy Potatoes \n2/5 - Lamb Salad \n2/5 - Lamb Wrap \n\nGreat experience for both in-dining and take-out.\n\nLet's start with the positive: \n\nFirst time we dined in- I ordered the chicken salad and hubs has the chicken wrap. The salad was PHENOMENAL. The flavors were perfection with the dressing and mixed greens with the mandarin oranges. I finished Every Last Bite. Hubs loved the chicken wrap too.\n\nWe also got a side of fries and the juicy potatoes. The fries were incredible, the juicy potatoes on the other hand were just not for me. Super gamey, so it was off putting. \n\nSecond visit we decided to try take out after an amazing experience dining in. We decided to go with lamb this time - so we did the salad the sandwich this time. I did the salad \"greek style\"...\n\nYikes. The lamb salad was SUPER gamey, I tried to stomach it but it just wasn't for me. The lamb is chopped up and not like typical gyro meat. If you're used to that style (which I am)- you may not like this. I ate around the meat of my salad. The dressing was fine but I could taste the \"gamey-ness\" in every bite and it was such a turn off. The greek style fries on top were delicious, but again I couldn't get over that taste!!!! For $18 it was a huge let down for me because most went in the trash (and I HATE wasting food...)\n\nMy husband felt similar towards his wrap but he still finished it. \n\nLastly! We ordered the baklava yogurt for dessert and WOW, worth the $8.69. Tart and creamy with a crunch and sweetness that is just amazing. \n\nUnfortunately I went to bed with a bit of a stomach ache. \n\nSO, that being said... beware of the gamey flavor of the lamb in these offerings because it is potent and not for everyone. I lost my appetite completely from this. \n\nFor now on, I'll stay with the chicken based items because it was so flavorful and nothing like the gamey lamb, and top it greek style with the fries!\n\nAlso, the take-out was well prepared and still warm when we got home, so that was a plus. The packaging was made well, with a modern and clean look- which I appreciate for the entire \"experience\" we paid for. Cashier was also very kind.",

      "text": "We've been wanting to try Souvlaki for awhile, and finally went with a Doordash delivery. We got a chicken and lamb sandwich, Greek fries, and the baklava frozen yogurt. \n\nUnfortunately, everything but the fries were pretty disappointing. The lamb and chicken in both the sandwiches were dry and the flavors were mild and not very tasty. Having been to Greece and having eaten the gyros there, my standards are probably unfairly high. However, I've had better gyros in the states and this is one of the poorer ones I've had.\n\nThe fries were pretty good, they were crispy and had a nice flavor to them. The baklava frozen yogurt was very strange. The baklava has a ton of cinnamon and doesn't really taste like a baklava. \n\nI've heard the salads here are good so maybe that's the way to go, but I sadly cannot recommend the restaurant and will not be eating here again.",

      "text": "I've once consumed 20 Souvla chicken salads in a single month...so you can say I'm pretty much obsessed with the chicken salad here! Nowadays though, after consistent price increases year after year, I don't find myself eating an almost $20 chicken salad as often as I've had a couple years ago, but it's still a nice treat every now and then! Tl;dr: Order the chicken salad (Greek style if you want fries) and baklava frozen Greek yogurt, skip the Black Sheep plant-based lamb salad/sandwich.\n\nBy now, I've tried most of the items on the menu including the chicken salad, chicken sandwich, pork salad, pork sandwich, lamb salad, lamb sandwich, Black Sheep plant based lamb salad, veg salad, Greek fries, baklava frozen yogurt, honey frozen yogurt, plain frozen yogurt, and Souvla Greek rosé. \n\nOf course, my all time favorite item is the chicken salad. I'm obsessed with the granch dressing, and all the ingredients go together so well! I order the salad Greek style (+$1) if I want to treat myself, meaning tons of fries topped on! Getting a salad Greek style is a way better bang for your buck than ordering a side of fries (+$5). My favorite frozen yogurt here is the baklava one, which is absolutely delicious! \n\nThe only time I've had a bad experience with anything at Souvla was when I ordered the Black Sheep plant-based lamb salad. I was really curious to try this plant based option when it first came out a while back, but the \"lamb\" was way too salty and dry! I couldn't finish it. If you're plant based, I recommend the veg (sweet potato) salad and sandwich options instead.",

      "text": "Heard so many people rave about Souvla so I expected a lot. Got the pork salad to go, and it was kinda disappointing. I appreciated how generous they were with the pork, but it tasted a bit too porky and gamey in not-good way. That gamey taste practically lingered around the entire time and I hated it. \n\nAside from that, the salad was a bit lackluster. The gamey pork taste overpowered everything. The salad needed something more. Something else. More texture. More freshness. Also added in a pita and their pita was practically like cardboard - not much taste and fluff. The yoghurt dressing was good though. Overall, I'd say skip the pork salad. Idk if I just made a wrong protein choice (I heard a lot of people say that the chicken was dry and that the pork was killer), or if Souvla overall is really just overrated, overpriced, and blah. Honestly you'd be better off going to another place for a salad.",

      "text": "The lamb sandwich leaves something to be desired, but the frozen Green yogurt (with baklava crumble), slaps. In fact, the dessert alone saves this from what would otherwise be a 3-star review. Came here on a recommendation from a friend. The TL;DR--if you want quality Mediterranean/Greek food, look elsewhere; the options are abundant in this area. I was underwhelmed by a lamb sandwich that was too small, and not altogether that flavorful. And for $16, I needed something more substantial. The side of garlic fries was small for the up-charge of $5 and not terribly garlicky. Come here for the dessert alone. There is something about how the sweetness of the baklava cuts the bitterness of the Green yogurt just right. They really nail this. It's a bit pricey at $8, but worth it for the journey it'll take your taste buds on.",

It's impossible to escape it in there and it stuck on me after I left when I got home. Maybe a lot of people don't even notice it. Maybe they're not attuned to it. I can't go in there. \n\nThey do not provide decent vegetarian options. Their fries are kinda greasy and they sprinkle cheese on them reflexively and without awareness that customers might not want it. True I could have maybe read a little more carefully into the menu item to see that there was cheese on it. But I just think this is expressive of the generally omnivorous nature of their menu. \n\nMy partner and I went in yesterday because we were looking for some French fries. They were kinda greasy, and cheesy. Maybe some people like them that way. We don't.",

Sweet salads are usually not my fav  but this one is so yummy. It's the perfect amount of both sweet and savory. It's so healthy and filling too. You HAVE to get their frozen Greek yogurt, specifically the Baklava Crumbles & Honey Syrup option- it's one of my favorite deserts in sf, I swear I could eat it every week.

The fries where the best I've had in at least a decade: golden brown and crispy on the outside and practically melting on the inside -- and at the same cost you'd pay for smaller quantity and far inferior quality at that infamous fast food place.

The guy at the register was so rude and asked us to move aside or read the menu outside because we were in the way of zero customers behind us. Everything was overpriced for small portions. The soup tasted yummy but tasted like pulled Costco rotisserie chicken meat and thrown in a cream of potato soup. Overrated, overpriced, and overly rude staff. Will never return to the restaurant.",

Better than ice cream, seriously. \n\nThe pork and lamb salads, however, were a bit of a let-down for me. I needed to add salt and hot sauce regularly and, while I loved how much protein was included, the meat was a bit dry. The salad was mixed well but the flavors were a bit muted for my taste. \n\nGiven that it's a fast-casual place, I'll probably be back to try their sandwiches! They also have outdoor seating so it's a great place for pets and people-watching.",

It's always a promising, hearty, and filling meal. \n\n- Chicken salad 5/5 (you can never go wrong with ordering this, it's light, tangy, refreshing and super filling) \n-  Veggie salad 5/5 (very strong olive oil and olive flavor, the sweet potatoes are delicious and adds a nice creamy touch) \n- Pork sandwich 4/5 (I actually prefer the flavor of the pork over the chicken, it's super juicy and flavorful but the pita they use is a bit dry/thick. So next time I might just get the salad version) \n- Side salad 4/5 (honestly very generous portion for only $6)\n- Fries 5/5 (these are some of the best fries I've ever had. Get it with the yogurt dip, it's so good!! \n\nGreek yogurt fro-yo (you have to try this if you're at Souvla) \n- my favorite was actually the cherry, but the most popular one is honey baklava. Both are fantastic choices! The yogurt is so creamy, tangy, and not overly sweet. Seriously the perfect dessert during any day of the week",

I used to come here all of the time (once a week at least) but got out of the habit during the pandemic because they were closed for a long time.\n\nLast week I came back and had a lamb salad, which felt like healthy(ish) comfort food. \n\nThe menu is very basic. There are four items, lamb, chicken, pork or yams. You can have them in pita form or salad form. All meats are spit roasted hypnotically in front of your very eyes. There are potatoes that catch all of the drippings or you can get french fries. There are giant cups of tangy fro yo with cherry or baklava toppings. For some reason these are served in classic NYC deli coffee cups. I am from NY and this is endearing for me. \n\nThe menu never changes, so sometimes I get sick of it and have to take a break. But I always come back. Now my kids love it too. There is an outpost of Souvla in almost ever neighborhood in SF. The food is wildly consistent. And always delicious.",

Try not to get too full though because you'll need to save room for the famous Greek yogurt soft serve! COVID protocols have all staff in masks and patrons have the option to sit inside (entryway door is open) or on the street front patio. \n\nCHICKEN SALAD (5/5) $16\nI was so full after eating this enormous salad. Chicken portion is very generous and meat is tender. The greens were of nice assortment and the red pickles add a delightful crunch. I prefer my sauces to the side,so you can request that too if that's your thing. \n\nBAKLAVA GREEK YOGURT (5/5) $6\nThe star of the show! I'm so glad I asked the cashier to split our 1 order into two portions. The baklava topping was still very generous even between two people, and we took it to go while we walked to Mission Dolores Park. It tasted like a creamy cobbler pie, where the sugary sweetness of the baklava is balanced with the slight tartness from the Greek yogurt. \n\nStreet parking is tough unless you're lucky enough to find a spot, but it's free of charge on Sundays.\n\nOverall, solid pick and would definitely come back for lunch again.",

I don't know if it's the rent increase or the overall food and labor increase.... but the quality and service is really really good so it's hard to drop them down because there aren't many other Greek Restaurants in the SF Bay area to compare? There are similar middle eastern restaurants who do a similar pita pocket, shawarma, gyro sandwiches but I really do find the quality and taste different. \nSouvla will need to reconsider their price as the economy slows down because I don't see how people will continue to afford paying this much for their delicious food? I'm already cutting down on my spending.... SF just makes it so hard to run a restaurant that I feel really bad but keep treating your customers with great service and good food, so they stay loyal.",

They need Food, and Food has Meat, and Souvla serves Food with Meat. The last time I've seen an order from here, that guy, that out of town guest, of course got the Extra Meat. He's not even a fat sack of crap, he just liked the idea of the extra meat, which he brought into my house and I couldn't eat anyway.\n\nWhen I used to eat meat, I would occasionally buy something from here. It isn't very good.\n\nIf you don't eat Meat, you look at your ticket for $24, and you will think, \"What the hell did I just order?\" It's a very expensive salad with (or without) a mediocre Meat. The crux is without the Meat, there's no addictive (or as some people call it, \"mouth watering\") part of this, you're not feeling like it's satisfying your need for Food-because-Food-is-Meat, so you will literally never go here.\n\nSouvla was built on a solid concept: there is a huge population of Food-is-Meat people, and let's minimize the restaurant - like the servers and staff or whatever - to most efficiently deliver Meat to the people. We can continue to charge $X for meat, because other places do, and our costs are lower than theirs, so we will stick around. Great business really.\n\nThere's an audience, and they will pay stupid amounts of money to satisfy their weird food problem. It is simply a majority condition, so nobody really thinks it's weird that every single meal has to be Meat with Extra Meat. I do, so I don't have a conniption about giving a Meat place that wasn't good when I used to eat Meat, and is not any better except more expensive, a poor review.\n\nYou should walk a little further to Mixt, which achieves the concept of the entrees here for lower cost, faster, and with more space. Even if you need Meat, it's all the same Meat.",

      "text": "Spectacular frozen yogurt! Cannot get enough of this stuff. The baklava and honey toppings are *chefs kiss*. Cool ambience and fast service as well. \n\nHowever, their food is a bit underwhelming. Got takeout for dinner on a Thursday night. Fries got the group's approval but the other dishes (veg salad, veg sandwich) were pretty underwhelming. I love love love lamb and am partial to mediterranean flavors so I was stoked to try their lamb sandwich. When it arrived I found there was an abundance of meat (heck yeah!) and it seemed well-dressed. Unfortunately when I actually got to eating it, the lamb didn't have too much flavor and there was basically nothing else inside the pita- all the feta crumbles and other things were decorative and on the outside. I ended up dressing it up with some homemade greek salad to give it a little liquid since it was pretty dry. \n\nI will 100% be returning for their frozen yogurt but I doubt I'll be eating anything else. Maybe I would have had better luck with their other dishes or at a different time.",

The greens always hit the spot and you have to get this Greek style (scoop of fries on top of the salad for $1!).\nThe portion for their side of fries is almost exactly the same amt and that's $5 - make it make sense.\nI get this salad easily once a week - it's the perfect lunchtime meal. \nPro-tip - buy their hot sauce bottle ($8)!

Can I just say that the Baklava Crumbles & Honey Syrup frozen Greek yogurt was divine? \n\nI've had Souvla on my list for a while now and so glad to make it downtown just to try their froyo. I've seen a friend post it on her IG story and it looked so delicious!!! And it really is! My coworker gave me a box of authentic baklava fresh from Athens before and every spoonful of this reminded me of that. The frozen yogurt is tarty -  just the way I like it. The baklava crumbles were aplenty, not just on the top - they were generous all the way through. Happy tummy! \n\nThe Souvla team member at the register personally liked the Greek Sour Cherry yogurt but I'm not a cherry person so I passed on that one. \n\nI'm tempted to try the Greek Olive Oil and Flaky Sea Salt flavor on my next visit, as well as the entrees for a proper sit down meal, once maybe COVID is over and we're all back to normalcy and dine-in is possible.\n\nImportant note - I suggest ordering ahead online because they have touchless payments. When I got there, the guy at the register said to Order Online (scan the barcode) before he can give me my yogurt cup. Just to save you some time!",

      "text": "** The following review reflects my takeout experience DURING the COVID-19 pandemic. **\n\nI tried their original location on Hayes when they first opened about five years ago, and honestly my most vivid memory was how crowded and chaotic it was. Recently I was walking on Hayes with my mask on, and that's the one section where I had to walk out into the traffic to maintain any semblance of safe distancing. I passed by this particular location during the hours when they closed off the block. Still crowded but much better probably because the pandemic has forced all proprietors to tape off sidewalks to specify where you wait to order, where to pick up, and...\n\n....where to stand if you're idly waiting. OCD sufferers can rejoice from the geographic specificity as can I as a newly minted hypochondriac. Surprisingly the order window was open when I was there, so I walked up and flashed a peek at the menu to remind me of their choices. The masked staffer was as cordial as he could be, and I decided to order the $16 Lamb Salad. As I stood in my identified section of the sidewalk, I was trying to recall the last time I had lamb since I don't eat much red meat anymore, but the prospect sounded good to me.\n\nWhen I picked up my order in good time, I carried it on my long walk back to SoMa. When I opened the box, I was pleased as there was plenty of tender leg of lamb mixed with slices of radish and cucumber, pickled red onion, harissa-infused yogurt, and crumbles of feta cheese, all on top of a bed of kale and green lettuce (photo: bit.ly/3bvRG5z). It was probably not the healthiest takeout option I could have purchased, but it was certainly satisfying. Perhaps Souvla is the one operation that would benefit from the discipline required of the pandemic.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...it's been a long time, honey lamb\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...didn't see the inside but they were taking all the necessary precautions outside \nSERVICE - 4.5 stars...made the most of a difficult situation\nTOTAL - 4 stars...oompah!\n\nRELATED - In the mood for Mediterranean?

The salad was such a great size I was so full I could barely finish it, but of course had room for the insane baklava frozen yogurt. Not only is the yogurt perfectly tart, but the baklava is BOMB.

I also got the Greek yogurt with baklava crumble that definitely lived up to the hype. \n\nMy friend got the oil and flaky sea salt on the frozen yogurt and it had a unique taste, definitely not for everyone.

My friend and I were pretty hungry and the last thing on my mind was a salad but I'm always down to try a new place. This spot did not disappoint. I love the menu because it's simple and there isn't a whole lot of food options, which means everything should be great since they specialize in making those few items. I went for the:\n\n1] Veg Salad ($13) - Super tasty and filling. They do give a lot of cheese and a bit much for my taste but still great nonetheless.\n\nMy friend ordered the chicken salad that also looked great but the:\n\n2] Frozen greek yogurt with baklava crumbles and honey syrup ($5) - This was amaaaazzzing, I'm so glad my friend let me try some. If I was full from my salad I probably would have gotten my own. A MUST GET ITEM!\n\nDefinitely a place I will be coming back to soon. I'm sad it took me until now to get introduced to this place but that's okay because now it can enjoy it going forward to coming back. \n\nVIBE: This place felt very homey and a great date place. It relatively open and not too loud. It's very clean.\n\nSERVICE: After you order, you get a number and someone brings you your salad. I believe the water you can serve yourself.",

Everything is self serve as well besides the dine in, they just give you the food that's about it. The utensils and napkins are on the table. Water station is next to the register.\nI ordered  the veg salad. Food was made pretty fast, since I got my food less than 5 minutes. The dressing was amazing and refreshing. The yam was delicious and actually complemented well with the salad. \nOverall the experience was amazing and delicious. I'll be coming back soon :)",

I feel healthy eating it, and it's also satisfying taste-wise. \n\nFor the lamb sandwich, the husband thinks it's good but worth $14 or $15. I agree, but maybe these are just SF prices and not that many other options in the city. He also thinks the lamb is a little dry. I've had better lamb wraps too, but all at places outside of SF.\n\nWe'd prob come back, but can't say this makes it into the weekly rotation.",

(I am more of a salad girl, so I guess that makes sense.) The dish had a good amount of ingredients. And it was huge! I couldn't even finish it. And I can eat a fair amount of salad. The lamb had a nice roast and good flavor. Went well with the yogurt. I don't remember being a huge fan of the dressing, but I just ate everything with the yogurt. Kept the veggies pure and added a nice creaminess.\n\nThere must be a reason they have so many locations. They must be doing something right. Glad I finally tried a salad.

The veggies (tomato, onion, cucumber) were all fresh and crispy. My only gripe is that the sandwich wasn't wrapped too tightly and fell apart about halfway through. I will say that my sandwich was a little pricey for its contents, but delicious nonetheless.\n\nI tried some of my friend's Greek Yogurt and it was so delicious! Loved the baklava crumbles on top!

My boyfriend didn't like it but I have no idea what is wrong with him, I could eat it almost every day.

To be honest it was just fine. The pork was dry and unappetizing so I kind of ate around it but the rest of the salad was whatever too.

Well, to be honest I crave their Greek frozen yogurt, which are to die for. \n\nTheir Greek salad's are simple and delicious available in chicken, pork and lamb. The salad's can also be made into a wrap as well. \n\nSouvla makes a hot sauce that pairs well with their salad and I kid you not, my friend and I usually finish an entire bottle as we keep pouring it into our salad bowls. Not that the salad's lack flavor, just that their hot sauce is really good. Oh you can also buy their hot sauce if you want to eat it at home. \n\nNow about their frozen yogurt; it comes in a blue and white cup with soft serve like swirl at the top, well just as you would see with soft serve ice cream in general. However, Greek frozen yogurt is, given the right toppings is a delicious alternative to ice cream. I usually opt for the classic honey drizzle, but other options include baklava honey crumb, and a deep red cherry sauce. \n\nSouvla has multiple locations in San Francisco: Valencia, Hayes Valley, Divisadero, and Chestnut. Greek whenever wherever, well not wherever but more locations to choose from.",

We had the brilliant idea of dipping the fries in the soft serve and oh man... it was amazing. If you're into the fries + ice cream combo, definitely try this! The fries are so fresh and hot.. crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Topped with oil, some parsley and cheese.. the fries were absolute perfection. The frozen greek yogurt was delicious as well and I liked the texture from the baklava crumbles. \n\nThis place gets pretty crowded (at least on the weekends) so you may have to wait a bit before a table opens up. There's some outdoor seating as well! Would definitely come back for those fries and greek yogurt as a quick on the go snack!",

Definitely felt an \"earthy\" environment when I first walked in, fairly clean, and reasonable amount of seating area both inside and out. \n\nThe menu is pretty limited, in a good sense because it makes decisions easy. I like how you can make your meal into a wrap or salad, with added sides if you choose. It's important for me to find restaurants with a healthier option/ alternative. We went with the chicken salad and a lamb salad. Both were really good and exceeded my expectations. The portions look big, but they are perfect enough to fill you up! Both salads came with a olive oil vinaigrette and a specialty dressing. The yogurt dressing with the lamb was a thick consistency, but a settled light taste (really good).",

Fries were very fresh and crispy. The dipping sauce complimented the fries perfectly, a must-try! As for my sandwich it was pretty big, it included meat and very fresh veggies that were yummy. I would reccomend using their hot sauce, it makes it 5x better! (If you like a little bit of spice)\n\nPrices are normal sf food prices. Customer service was friendly and fast!\n\nDefinitely would come back to try their soft serve greek yogurt next time!",

As soon as I came in, the person behind the counter assumed I either wanted a drink or a froyo and not food - which was kind of weird. He was in a hurry to take my order and I felt really rushed. I got my froyo with baklava crumbs and honey right away. There are other toppings you could get but the others didn't look so appetizing.. Based on other Yelpers/photos, it looks like the others aren't as popular.\n\nI was fairly dissapointed with the taste. Again this is GREEK frozen yogurt so the sourness and tartness will hit you. I tried to scoop some baklava and honey with every bite I took. But eventually, it became overwhelming and I didn't want to finish it all. I wouldn't pay $6 for something like this again.

      "text": "A friend of mine from NYC was visiting from out of town, and decided to take her to one of my go-to spots, Souvla! If you're looking for a fine-fast Greek restaurant, this is your place! I usually go to the one of Hayes Valley location, but being in the Mission, the Valencia Street location was more convenient to get to. We got there around 7ish on a Saturday night, and surprisingly there was no line and even open tables! I was very surprised as the Hayes Valley location always seems crowded.\n\nI usually order the chicken or lamb salad, but decided to try the pork salad this time around. The pork salad came with minted greek yogurt, cherry tomato, picked red onion, cucmber, and feta cheese. The pork was okay. I prefer the chicken or lamb as the meat seems more tender. The sauce on the chicken salad is their special \"granch\" dressing, and the lamb has a harissa-spiked yogurt. There is plenty of meat and salad portions in both the chicken, pork, and lamb options. And if you're not a salad person, you can have it sandwich style. I would also suggest ordering their greek fries which is seasoned with olive oil, lemon juice, parsley, and mizithra cheese. Their fries are delicious, seasoned so well, and also goes really well with sprinking the fries on the salad ;D \n\nI have heard their frozen greek yogurt is delicious as well, but have yet to try it.\n\nIt is very cost affordable for SF as well. And if there is a line at Souvla and you don't want to wait, take it to go and eat it elsewhere with a good drink :)",

They're consistently high quality with fresh kale and tender rotisserie meats. The vegetarian one is excellent as well, I love the olives that it comes with. I typically stray away from the sandwich as the pita is not warm and you get less filling which is what I am looking for. \n\nPRO-TIP: Order greek style and get your salad topped with fries, not enough fries that it means you should have just eaten a burrito, but just enough to satisfy those cravings.\n\nside note: I frequent both the Hayes and Mission one and I swear for some reason the Hayes one is slightly better",

      "text": "Souvla is one of my favorite fast casual eats!! I always get the Mary's Free Range Chicken Salad and the Frozen Greek Yogurt with Baklava Crumbles. The salad has so many different notes of flavor with the refreshing lettuce, juicy chicken, sweet mandarin oranges, creamy \"granch\" dressing and picked red onions. All of these flavors work together to create the perfect healthy salad that makes you feel great! Pro tip: add fries to your salad to make it more hearty and satisfying!\n\nThe Frozen Greek Yogurt is the best way to finish the meal. The Greek yogurt is tart and has great texture and the baklava crumbles adds the perfect amount of sweetness. I typically share the salad and Greek yogurt with a friend. The service is fast although it can be difficult to find a seat as it gets very busy! Highly recommend for a healthy spot with great eats!",

With that said it was still good but I think they could improve it by adding more seasoning to it. The pork shoulder that hubby got was flavored much better. The lemon chicken soup was very tasty, as always. The roasted potatoes were actually the best thing.

This place had been on my bookmark list for a long time and I was happy to finally give it a try. \n\nI was not disappointed. The line wasn't too bad, even for a very sunny Saturday afternoon. I ordered myself the Greek beer($6), the frozen Greek yogurt with Baklava($5), and the chicken sandwich($13). \n\nEach item was great. I'm not the biggest beer guy, but from my experience and what the rest of my cohorts (friends) said, the beer was pretty good! The sandwich was my favorite. The chicken was super juicy and tender, and the rest of the sandwich and toppings complimented it perfectly. My friends ordered the Greek fries, with \"granch\" which is a ranch/Greek yogurt mix, and they complimented the sandwich perfectly. The fries were tender and for 5 bucks you get plenty. Lastly the Frozen Greek yogurt topped off the awesome lunch. The yogurt tasted great, the baklava topping was icing on the cake. All around the experience was great and I had no complaints. I will be back soon to try more items on their menu! Opa!!",

It's light, yummy, refreshing, and the flavors pair well with each other. The chicken, depending on when you come, can get a bit dry sometimes. But again, hot sauce is the answer to your problem.\n\nAlso recommend their Greek fries with garlic aioli sauce, good to share with someone if you're both getting your own salad. The sauces (don't be fooled) are $1, but it's just not the same without it so I have to get it.\n\nOverall this location can get a bit packed sometimes, and the lack of 5 stars is mostly because I didn't enjoy their sandwiches as much, but clearly I keep coming back so definitely recommend trying it :)",

It's almost not even worth it anymore but this delivery from Souvla honestly blew me away.]\n\n1. The Packaging: as a designer, I appreciate the attention to branding and packaging a lot and everything was sorted and labeled so well. It made me more excited to open it!\n\n2. Lamb Salad: I LOVE lamb (it's my favorite meat) so I was a little weary of ordering it in a salad, but there was SO much going on and it all worked so harmoniously together. It was actually super refreshing and filling with generous helpings of lamb. So good!\n\n3. Garlic fries: I've been avoiding fries for dietary reasons, but they came with the salad as a meal and I couldn't resist. Wow. My fry standards are pretty damn high and these were some damn good fries. And the sauces! I got one of each and they were all bomb.\n\n4. Honey Froyo: I've recently developed an affinity for honey and this was a perfect treat. The frozen yogurt was super creamy and a little tart, which worked really well with the honey. I'd love to come back and try the baklava version next time!\n\nHoping the in-house experience is just as good! Can't wait to try more.",

They have a slight crisp on the exterior and a soft interior. The Chicken Salad comes with fennel, navel orange slices, pickled red onion, \"granch\" dressing and mizithra cheese.

      "text": "With Yelp at my side, I've forgotten the simple joy that comes with walking into somewhere with no prior knowledge and being delighted with the results. \n\nWe'd originally planned on getting ice cream at Bi-Rite, but I saw people walking past with these giant cups of yogurt and decided I had to have some. There was a line for Souvla that went out the door, but it moved quickly. In addition to their delicious frozen Greek yogurt options, they've got real food too, from lamb to pork, which can be made into a wrap or a salad. The price is also not bad at all, considering you get a heaping cup of frozen yogurt for $5, when a tiny little cup from Smitten will cost the same. \n\nThe yogurt has that classic tartness but is also thick, and combined with the sweetness of honey, it's a great refreshing summer dessert. I actually didn't like the baklava crumbles that much because they made my ice cream a bit too sweet - it actually would've tasted great without any add-ons. There's a good amount of seating inside at the tables, with families enjoying their Sunday afternoons. Tasty, (kind of) healthy, and has a lovely casual vibe. Definitely going to stop by again for some of their Greek fries!",

I wouldn't call it crumbles. More like honey drenched baklava ball. I would have preferred if it was crispier and lighter rather than sickingly sweet and dense. \n\nEnvironment is nice -- fast casual light and clean. Also prices are very reasonable here ... just $5 for the froyo and $11-13 for the wraps. I am a fan of their other location so I would definitely revisit here or there again.",

      "text": "I love that their menu is simple and easy to read. I was able to choose what I wanted within a minute or two.\n\nIt was a weekday at night and it was pretty packed. The cashier was super friendly which instantly brightened my mood. My friend and I were waiting for a table for the longest time since most people looked like they started eating. This was around 7:30pm. We got our food before getting a table, but the employees were really nice and tried to help us find tables. Shout out to the bus boy for cleaning efficiently once I sat down in front of someone's finished/ used bowl.\n\nPork sandwich ($11) - Absolutely delicious. The pork was seasoned and cooked perfectly. It was tender yet juicy. The vegetables were fresh - cucumber was crunchy and red onions were sweet. This was hands down the best wrap I ever had at a Greek/Mediterranean place. I was amazed,\n\nFrozen Greek yogurt with baklava crumbles and honey ($5) -  The baklava crumbs and honey adds a nice contrast flavor with the frozen yogurt. I think the frozen yogurt would've been too plain if there wasn't any toppings. The frozen yogurt has more of a milk taste and every bite with the baklava crumbs tasted like happiness.\n\nRecommended this place to a few of my friends and some of them already tried it and loved it. Definitely will be back to try their salads next time. Until next time!",

      "text": "Came here on a Monday night after dinner to get the Greek frozen yogurt as dessert. We got the olive oil and sea salt flavor and asked the staff to add honey to it. The olive oil and is definitely very interesting. As you eat the frozen yogurt, puddles of olive oil will ooze our and you have to eat it together. The sea salt made the yogurt taste savory which was a weird taste... so if you are trying this flavor, I recommend adding honey to it, which brings back the sweetness of the dessert.\n\nI didn't really love this particular flavor, but the yogurt itself without the additional toppings was actually really good. It's very light but satisfying. I wish I could try the other flavors! \n\nInterior: very spacious seating and it's pretty dark at night.",

I ordered the lamb sandwich, the fries, and the baklava/honey Greek yogurt. \n\nLike many reviewers, I agree that some of the bites of the lamb was dry. I couldn't really chew one of the pieces I had. The vegetables are actually really good and my favorite part of the sandwich. Nice crunch and flavor which  is a nice change from when you sometimes get soggy lettuce and mushy tomatoes in a gyro sandwich. They were also light on the harissa sauce. \n\nThe fries were cooked greatest, good crunch, and good flavor. I got the harissa sauce on the side and it was a nice complement. \n\nThe Greek yogurt was definitely the star and why I think this place has so many 4 stars. The tartness of the yogurt goes really well with the very sweet baklava and the baklava offers a nice contrasting crunch. \n\nIf I came again, I probably would just opt for the fries and dip it in the yogurt. Yes, fries in the yogurt. Yeah I said it. Did that blow your mind? Boom.",

During Covid, there isn't any seating but we ordered our food online and the food was ready when we arrived. I ordered the lamb salad and I felt the lamb to salad proportion was so off. It was half lamb and half vege. I mean I appreciate them piling on the lamb and it's a more expensive ingredient but it was not balanced. The lamb lacked much flavor and it was kind of off-putting. The veges were fine but it's a salad so if it was bad...that's a major problem. I ordered it Greek style so got some fries piled on top and that was the delight of the dish. I mean you can't go wrong with oily potatoes so I found myself digging around for vege and fries and pushing the lamb to the side. Maybe it was an off day, maybe I need a sandwich for the bread. I dunno what went wrong but I'm not giving up and will be willing to try again.",

It's not too sweet, not too tart, and perfect to grab on a nice day. My only comment, though, is that the frozen Greek yogurt with Baklava and honey is way too much for one person. If you are alone, get one of the other flavors!",

I know Souvla has been on the forefront of the fancy-waiterless place and it seems to have worked out all the kinks. Food came out really quickly! The lamb salad was packed with lamb and tons of veggies. I probably could have saved half of it for later. My wife's sweet potato wrap was less awesome, as it basically had huge chunks of sweet potato and not nearly as many other vegetables. \nWe also got the frozen greek yogurt, which was tasty but a little overrated. The honey was tasty but ended up freezing into a taffy (which was still really good). There wasn't quite enough baklava topping- they only put it on top instead of integrating it throughout the yogurt. I would go back if I wanted some tasty lamb in the mission, but with an eye on how expensive it is!",

The last two times I've ordered food at this restaurant the lamb was overcooked and dry. What used to be a juicy lamb sandwich turned into something that tasted like old lamb that had been reheated several times. When my mother, who is visiting from New York, tried her lamb sandwich she asked me If the meat inside the sandwich was hamburger meat. I was appalled, and had to answer, \"no I'm so sorry it's just really over cooked lamb\". Sad. Not sure why great restaurants that become successful lose sight of the one thing that can ruin their food and brand - quality control.",

Which has fries, cucumbers, red onions, lamb, and feta cheese. The lamb itself was borderline bland and there were definitely too much cucumber to meat ratio. I am a huge fan of the yogurt sauce that is included but sadly there were only drops of it and they charge extra for sauce.

I agree with a few other reviewers- the shawarma needs something to give it some extra kick, something acidic or spicy perhaps.  Nice place!",

Some people seem to get caught up on the \"Greek\" aspect and although this is a far cry from Greece/ Greek (I personally don't even categorize it as Greek in my mind) it is GOOD. Maybe we could call it new american Greek... new Greek?\n\nFrom the white tile and copper counters to the limited menu it is perfect. Their chicken salad is my constant go to (order Greek style for some fries on top when you don't want a whole order), but I have tried all the meat wraps and they are equally delish.\n\nWine is served by the glass, 500 ml and bottle. The 500 ml is a personal go to, and is a perfect glass and a half to share between two when you don't want to commit to a whole bottle, school nights kill. \n\nFinally, although I do not partake regularly I recently had their Greek yogurt soft serve which is to die for with a variety of toppings like olive oil and salt, granola, and sour cherry.",

      "text": "LOVE this place for casual yet delicious meat and veggie-packed Mediterranean food!\n\nThis location is right on Valencia among all the shops and is perfect to stop for lunch to dine in, or take to-go for a day picnicking out in Dolores Park. The menu keeps it pretty simple with a few spit-fired proteins to choose from such as pork shoulder and free-range chicken. You just pick which you want and choose whether you want it in your salad or sandwich (which I think they should just call a pita wrap for clarification).\n\nI opted for the pork shoulder sandwich to take to-go ($13). I gotta say I was a bit iffy on the price since it didn't even include any sides (+$5), but it was surprisingly filling! The pita was light and fluffy and big enough to hold all of the stuff inside. Everything including the salty feta, pickled red onions, cucumber, and cherry tomatoes all added to the flavor and great texture of the wrap. They were also pretty generous with the amount of pork shoulder that was all throughout the \"sandwich.\" The meat was mostly tender (only slightly dry), but not greasy. For a carb meal, it's surprisingly light! I'm also glad they put their take-out in a box in addition to wrapping it in paper--if I was at the park, it would definitely be nice to catch all the toppings that fall as you eat (and maybe bring a fork). \n\nOverall I was impressed by the food here! I love Mediterranean food and love that it's pretty light yet filling with meat, veggies, and pita. It's a bit pricey at $13, but I would definitely come again because they do a solid job!",

      "text": "Immediately upon entering this restaurant, my nostrils were flooded with steamy tendrils of volatile caproic acid emanating from the lamb meat visibly roasting in the background. I enjoyed the scent as it hugged around me, supplying my friends and me with an imaginary warm woolen blanket on the cold day that it was.\n\nAnd so cozily nestled in this enjoyable atmosphere, my friends and I felt confident to fulfill our original mission: to order a frozen greek yogurt with baklava crumbles and honey syrup. After my first bite of the dessert I quickly realized that I had never before tried FROZEN greek yogurt before, but I was at a loss as to why not, as it was extremely delicious and seemingly not difficult to prepare. The baklava and honey additionally added some great textural components as well, while not distracting too much from the deep proteinaceous flavors contained within the Greek-ness of the yogurt.\n\nAs we quickly devoured the yogurt, our mission was achieved - universally deemed a success by all those who partook in its completion. Unfortunately I can't speak about any of their other items on the menu. But if you're ever in the area and want a nice and interesting frozen treat, I highly recommend trying their Greek frozen yogurts!",

      "text": "After a night out in San Francisco, my body needed something nourishing. My friend and I were walking around the Mission and found Souvla for lunch. For a fast casual spot, this was overall quite enjoyable. The line moved quickly and I thought the atmosphere was trendy but in a casual way. I also liked that the menu was simple, making it easy to pick something out. There's pork, chicken, lamb, and a vegetarian option for your meat. You can either get your meat in a salad or in a wrap.\n\nI chose the pork shoulder salad ($13). All my friends will tell you that I am not a salad eater at all (I know, I'm bad!), but almost everyone in the restaurant was eating the salad instead of the wrap. However, I really enjoyed my salad. The lettuce was nicely dressed without being overly soggy, and the sweetness from the tomatoes and acidity of the red onions tasted great together. The pork overall was pretty moist, though some pieces were much more lean compared to others, making the texture not always the same. I love meat, but I have to say that the ratio of meat to lettuce was off. I finished all my lettuce and toppings (including every bit of that delicious feta cheese), but I had a bunch of meat leftover. \n\nMy friend and I also ordered greek fries with a side of garlic spread and they were also good. The garlic spread was divine, and the fries were crispy and light. However, the $5 price tag did seem high to me as a non-San Franciscan. \n\nTo finish off my meal, I ordered greek yogurt soft serve with wildflower honey. I haven't had anything like this before, but I enjoyed it thoroughly. It did leave an interesting mouth-feel though, almost a little dry/gritty at the end. Nonetheless, I'd order this again!",

Their chicken salad is the best salad I've ever had in SF so far. I love how they put mandarin oranges which adds tons of flavors to this salad! I'm not a huge fan of adding fruits in my salad but this one was amazing! I think this salad definitely deserves the hype! \n\nPork shoulder sandwich was delicious too but it wasn't that memorable to me. \n\nLastly, their FROYO! Frozen yogurt with baklava was AMAZING! And it was a refreshing way to finish our meal! And that baklava was insanely good! It was sweet, chewy and sticky. If you like nuts, try their froyo with bakalava!\n\nThe atmosphere here is casual, cozy and lively! It's hard to find seating especially on weekends because it's always packed with people. I think it's little overpriced but I can't complain because it's sooo delicious.\n\nHighly recommend this place! I would definitely come back to try their salads with greek style. Solid 5 stars!",

Lots of chicken in the sandwich and the salad was gorgeous (as well as delicious). The fries were amazing, especially with the garlic dip. The roasted potatoes were a little limp and oily for me, so would skip those next time. Their house beer was light and paired well with the food.\n\nI wish that the sandwich had a bit more flavor, perhaps via a hot sauce option or even more traditional options like a Harissa or Chermoula sauce. There was a red pepper/vinegar hot sauce on the table but I didn't find that it added a lot. Perhaps I needed to add more than I did.\n\nI think my main issue is that I generally want more Mediterranean flair in my Mediterranean food. I would certainly revisit Souvla in the future if I were in the area.\n\nService and decor were good, you order and then grab a table.

Similar to my first experience eating at Souvla, I got very generous portions of both meat and salad. Highly recommend, even if you aren't necessarily a fan of salad.",

It's so much better! \n\nI'll start with the Avgolemono Soup- perfect for cold days or when you're feeling under the weather. It's a traditional egg-lemon soup with chicken and rice. It'll make you pucker up, and the thick broth with soft rice and shredded chicken goes down nicely. It warms my belly and puts a smile on my face every time I have it. \n\nThe pork wrap is like a Greek Burrito- overflowing with homestead pork shoulder, minted greek yogurt, cherry tomatoes, pickled red onions, cucumbers, and of course, feta. \nThis also comes in a salad version.\n\nSave room for dessert: Frozen Greek Yogurt!\nMy favorites are the Baklava Crumbles & Honey Syrup and the Greek Olive Oil & Flaky Sea Salt.

      "text": "Souvla provides decent Greek food but at a high price.\n\nI ordered the chicken salad, but it was a bit too tangy. The salad was relatively healthy, though the chicken was not of the style offered at more authentic Greek restaurants. I ordered a harissa tinged yogurt side to put on top to give the salad more flavor. Just the salad alone was about fifteen dollars with tax, which is a lot for what it was and the ambience of the restaurant. The fries were solid (as most fries are), and I would recommend choosing the garlic dipping sauce. \n\nThe frozen Greek yogurt was worth ordering because it is pretty unique.  The baklava that came with ours was frozen solid, however, and so it wasn't possible to have a bite of baklava with each frozen yogurt bite. Other orders didn't have this problem so it was likely an issue specific to the batch we were given.\n\nOverall, if you're in the mood for Mediterranean food I'd go elsewhere. It's still enjoyable food, but not for the price point and not with so many other options available.",

      "text": "Tasty Mediterranean food in a hip but down to earth atmosphere! The frozen greek yogurt here is also delicious if you have a sweet tooth and want to try something unique.\n\nI tried the chicken pita sandwich, which was fresh and delicious. The navel orange had a really nice bright contrast to the chicken, veggies, and creamy dressing. Not to mention, the pita was warm and super fluffy. My favourite part of the meal, though, was the frozen greek yogurt with baklava topping and honey. I'm a huge fan of baklava, so that's actually what made me decide to come here in the first place. The frozen green yogurt was perfectly tangy and rich to pair with the crispy, aromatic baklava crumbles on top. Finally, the honey drizzle on top sealed the deal to complete an amazing dessert. \n\nI came for lunch on a Sunday and had no problems getting seating. I absolutely love the interior design in here: super airy and bright, modern and inviting. You order at the counter and then seat yourselves, so this is a great place for a casual meal. Moreover, the food comes quickly after you're seated, which is always a good thing. I liked that when I ordered the frozen greek yogurt with my sandwich, I was given a receipt so I could get the dessert whenever I wanted to after I was done the sandwich. \n\nIf you're looking for a delicious, casual meal in SF, Souvla is the place to be! Besides, who doesn't want some frozen greek yogurt with honey and baklava topping?",

I got the salad and my companion went for the sandwich. The salad had way more meat. It was actually so big I couldn't finish it. Super filling but light. Still had room for dessert though. We shared the frozen Greek yogurt with honey and baklava, also really good. The yogurt is tart and mixes well with the sweet toppings. If you're in the mood for a light but filling quick lunch, this is a great choice.",

      "text": "I have been to two different Souvla locations and absolutely love them both. I get the Pork salad and add fries on top! Seriously, amazing. The most filling salad I have ever eaten. The dressing compliments all of the veggies and the meat is quite good. The hot sauce is a great add on to any salad. It's honestly not even that spicy at all, and just adds some flavor. \n\nBest part of the meal - the dessert. If you go here, you MUST try their soft serve. Even if you don't go for the salad or wrap. They offer soft serves (tart flavor) in many different combinations. My favorite is the baklava and honey. The tart soft serve along with a hefty scoop of baklava and fresh honey on top... to die for. \n\nOne thing to note about this location in the Mission: no outdoor seating in the back! There's a bar in the front of the restaurant near the queue to order, but other than that, there is no seating in the backyard of the restaurant (as seen in other locations). Therefore, seating can be hard to find.",

Ordered a chicken sandwich, Greek fries and the lemon chicken soup.\n\nThe food came out quickly which I'm thankful for since my child was starting to get impatient.\n\nThe chicken sandwich was good but I would have preferred it without the orange slices in there. 3/5\n\nThe fries were amazingggg. Crispy on the outside and soft and creamy on the inside. My fave. (5/5)\n\nThe soup was more of a rice porridge with a lemon zing to it. I probably won't order it again. I probably would had loved it without the lemon but that's me and maybe that combination is great to others. (2/5)\n\nThen I decided, heck, why not a soft serve so I got the baklava honey crumble soft serve which was a nice portion for two. Tasty and light despite my topping choice. (4/5)",

      "text": "I've been to this location and the one in Hayes Valley multiple times, and I have to say the biggest contributing factors to this positive review are the atmosphere and the frozen Greek yogurt. Those two factors make me want to give this spot a 5, whereas the meal itself is also somewhere around a 3.5 for me. \n\nMy main issue with the food isn't so much of a problem, but rather lack of \"wow\" factor. It's solid food that I always appreciate, but it never fully blows me out of the water. The lamb is definitely the best meat of them all. The \"sandwich\" (really just a gyro) and the salad are about the same to me - I just get whatever I'm more in the mood for. I never feel bad about myself after eating this because it feels vaguely healthy and the portion sizes are just right. I also never totally feel comfortable with the $12+ I spend on a okay meal - especially when I could've had my socks blown off at a better, cheaper place in the Mission. \n\nMeanwhile, the frozen Greek yogurt (and the ease and proximity to my apartment) keeps me coming back here again and again. I am such a huge fan of the texture and taste (was a huge Go Greek when living in LA) of frozen Greek Yogurt, and Souvla does it so well. I like it all ways that it's offered - with honey, with olive oil & salt, and with the cherry syrup. My favorite might controversially be plain, though. I find the honey gets oddly hard when in contact with the cold ice cream and there's always a little bit too much salt for my taste with the olive oil. \n\nThe atmosphere is also really nice - casual enough to hang out with almost anyone while also nice enough to impress almost anyone. You could bring parents, Tinder dates, visiting friends, and work colleagues. \n\nAnyhow, I'll be back here again and again most likely. I'm still waiting to be impressed by the food here, though.",

There aren't large tables in there either, so not the best for a large party.\n\nOn to the food - I tried their chicken sandwich was delicious. I loved the dressing, cheese, and surprise ingredient of navel oranges. It's a refreshing dish and if you love greek food, this will hit the spot. I'm definitely coming back to try their salads too. Knocking a star off because the chicken was a little sparse in my sandwich and didn't have the best flavor on its own. But overall, the sandwich was good because of all the other delicious fillings. Note: it's more of a pita wrap not an actual sandwich.\n\nMake sure to save room for their baklava froyo; it's to die for! The yogurt is tart and creamy which is perfectly complemented with the super sweet syrupy baklava. I've never been a huge fan of baklava because of its intense sweetness but it goes perfectly with a tart yogurt. Highly recommend checking this place out!",

The yogurt was creamy and tasty and the baclava added yhe right sweetness. The wrap had great presentation and was soft warm and left me feeling healthy. My only qualm is it had no spices or kick at all.(i blame all the local techies who think mayo is spicy) I added some of the hot sauce they had which helped tho.",

      "text": "This review is for their frozen Greek yogurt only!\n\nI'm a huge froyo lover, and this place totally knocked my socks off! I got the Baklava Crumbles & Honey Syrup ($5). The texture is thick and creamy (maybe because it's GREEK yogurt?), which is a huge difference from the thin, almost soupy consistency of most other frozen yogurts. The yogurt has the perfect balance between tart and sweet and doesn't have much of the overly sugary \"processed\" taste that I sometimes get at lower quality froyo shops. $4-5 for a coffee-cup-sized amount of frozen Greek yogurt might seem a bit pricey, but the cup is filled to the top and the yogurt is dense! Souvla also doesn't skimp out on the baklava crumbles, because I got plenty of crunch in every bite. After having a taste of Souvla's frozen Greek yogurt, I'm not sure if I can go back to a typical froyo shop anymore! Once I get the chance, I'm 100% going to swing by here again to try the other flavors!!!",

This dish is also, great to share with another person. We ordered the American Homestead Pork Shoulder salad and sandwich, Mary's Free-Range Chicken salad, and Creten Wildflower Honey Frozen Greek Yogurt. \n\nThe Pork salad the Greek way was delicious and every bite was flavorful and such a delight.

My fav all star item is still the Greek Froyo with Baklava Crumbles and Honey ($5), but the sandwiches are also quite tasty. The most popular option amongst my group was definitely the lamb sandwich ($13), but we also tried the chicken ($12) and the pork ($11). The pork sandwich may have been a little dry in my opinion. \n\nTIP: The sandwiches are quite filling (and so did the salads after eyeing my neighbors) and fall on the pricier end for sandwiches, so you can always ask them to cut it in half and share! Or just take the other half to go and get yourself another meal out of it.",

We had gotten Boba Guys tea (also a delicious SF must!) before grabbing lunch, and the drink was accidentally cleared away when they bussed the table from the customers before us. It was clearly an innocent mistake and we almost didn't say anything, but when we did they comped our whole meal!

There were only a few people left so we're able to sit comfortably and enjoy a spacious restaurant to ourselves. It has a nice, aesthetic interior with a small outdoor seating area that extends onto the sidewalk.\n\nI shared one cup of Baklava crumbles and honey syrup frozen greek yogurt which was $5. I initially thought it was expensive but it came in a pretty big cup, and was actually a good size for two people for dessert after our meal. Baklava is a rich, sweet dessert pastry filled with nuts and was crispy and crunchy, it went so well with the greek yogurt. It was a bit warm too and the subtle sweetness was a nice combination with the greek yogurt.\n\nI've had their main entrees before but not at this location, and I remember it being great. So since the frozen greek yogurt I had here was pretty good, I'm sure they have other good stuff. So I'm excited to come back again.\n\nThis place isn't really a restaurant, but you order at the counter and they bring your order to you. It's a fast, casual dining spot, that isn't too expensive and it's something nice if you want a quick place to eat or a place to hang!",

The chicken meat is roasted to perfection and the ingredients of the salad - the kale, cheese, orange- go great together! Portions are good, you won't leave this place hungry. Yet to try their Greek Yoghurt!",

      "text": "My sister brought us here for a quick lunch before our flight out of SFO.  What a fun idea.  \nFirst of all this is a \"Greek\" inspired restaurant. Just in case you were not sure.  It is a smaller quaint restaurant with very fresh options.  \nWe ordered the chicken and pulled pork salads.  First of all the portions are immense!  Easily for 2.  My favorite was the Chicken as it was very savory.  \nWe also ordered the lemon soup which was very soothing and palatable even for my 4 yo niece.  \n\nThey do have greek inspired Froyo so give it a try.  \n\nOverall for the price this place was wonderful. Perfect healthy quick lunch option in Dolores Park in the heart of San Fran.  Looking forward to trying it again on our next trip back to the Bay area.",

I got the frozen yogurt with baklava crumbles and honey, which the cashier recommended, and she kindly offered to split the portions into two cups so my friend and I could share at no extra cost. It was definitely a big portion, and I appreciate that offer and her doing that.\n\nNevertheless, I just felt like I was eating somewhat regular frozen yogurt with sweet bits and honey. Nothing particularly special, and not really for me.",

      "text": "The place was super lively when we came on a Saturday night. Their menu is pretty simple, the main is either (pita) sandwiches or salads with pork, chicken, lamb, or veggie as the main protein. I got the chicken sandwich, which was filling and yummy. The chicken was tender and flavorful and I liked that there were orange slices for the topping. For dessert, I tried the baklava and honey frozen greek yogurt. It was tasty, but I wasn't a big fan of having the baklava crumbles mixed in, it was a little too sweet. I heard the one with olive oil and sea salt is a must try. \n\nInterior is modern and nicely decorated. It's pretty much a hip fast food dining spot. There's decent seating inside and outside. Service was quick and friendly! I enjoyed the food and the casual atmosphere. Def looking forward to coming back!",

I asked the lady at the cashier if I could get some extra tzatziki sauce that I could  put on my souvlaki sandwich. And the lady told me that I have to pay $1.50 for the extra tzatziki sauce. It's disappointing that for a tiny cup of sauce I really still have to pay while I bought 2 items on their menu & getting the extra sauce should be complimentary. It isn't about paying the extra dollars (I'm not cheap!) but it's about good customer service & satisfaction. \nAnd also the chicken sandwich turned out to be so dry & the pork meat need some seasoning.

The chicken was a bit on the dry side and the fries were tasty but not as crispy as it could be. The yogurt and spicy sauce was yummy. I just think for 13+ dollars it should and could taste much better than this. The choices of ingredients they use is very good though, navel oranges and pickled red onions  gave it good flavor. The pea shoots got in the way of eating and it noted fennel in the descriptions but I think I got 1 thin slice. Overall it has potential, but I'm not sure if it's worth the 13 dollars.

I am middle eastern and normally avoid Mediterranean salads because most of the time they skimp on the important toppings and leave you with romaine lettuce to the end of the bowl.

The price is right as well for the quality of the food. \n\nTurns out the frozen yogurt is even amazing.

      "text": "I really wanted to like this place, as altho not really Greek the food looked good and it's right across the street.\nBUT, after 2 bad experiences, as I cannot count to 3, here is my review.\n#1. Friend brought me the pork sandwich. Dry, cold, and... off tasting. But  everything else was Ok, so I thought I'd try it again.\n#2 experience.\nBIG MISTAKE! Last night friend brought me the lamb sandwich. The lamb was cold, dry, and just slightly gamey, like an older lamb not a baby lamb. At Least that's what I thought. \nThis morning I was so ill. Food poisoning is the only thing that upsets my digestive system like this. Without being too graphic, lets just say that after 5 yes FIVE visits to the john with explosive events (almost didn't make it the last time diarrhea to boot) I *might* be Ok. Totally exhausted from my body violently expelling everything.\nNEVER AGAIN!",

      "text": "Warmly sparse, bright space, five-ish items on the menu, I wasn't immediately sure what all the fuss is abt given that at first glance everything sounds tasty but not mind boggling, a mistake I realized as soon as I processed \"roasted white sweet potato with kalamata olive, toasted walnut\" and \"pea shoots and kale\" in the same sentence, followed shortly by \"frozen greek yogurt with olive oil and flaky sea salt\". Swoon. \n\nWhether you're going veg or carnivore, the options are quite similar - lamb, chicken, or pork is paired with greens, a bit of yogurt sauce, something acidic (tomatoes, pickled onions), balanced with a bit more dairy (feta, mizithra), if you're sans protein, sweet potatoes add substance and walnuts are thrown in for crunch - whether you have it as a salad or roll it in a pita, it's glorious. \n\nIf you're hangry, get the wrap, making the whole thing a touch heartier - or go for a salad +  juicy potatoes (drippings, starch) to ensure maximum fully belly, though the salads solo are relatively satisfying. The \"Greek fries\", while decent, aren't anything to write Athens abt. \n\nGets wild around peak meal times. Seating limited. For the win, take it to go and stroll to Dolores for optimal people watching, returning later for the Greek fro-yo, which has to be one of the best things I've put in my mouth. Ever.  Tart, smooth, bearing none of the chemical/gritty qualities that many associate with anything swirled from a machine.\n\nSandwiches and salads $10-14, sides $2-6, greek yogurt $3-5. Simply lovely. Will be back.",

      "text": "EXCELLENT delivery from Soulva, courtesy of Caviar. Everything was very, very good. Only thing I can ding them for was forgetting my order of their Greek Fries (sad face!). But the food quality was so good, I'll just chalk it up to human error and ask for a Caviar refund, no sweat.\n\nIt was all so good, I ate it all before I thought of taking any photos. But it looked very edible and neatly packaged ;-) \n\nAvgolemono Soup (Traditional Greek egg-lemon soup with rice and chicken): SO GOOD. Delicious, homey, like something my grandma would make if she was Greek rather than Scottish. $6 for bowl (about 2 cups in container). \n\nPork Sandwich (American homestead pork shoulder with minted Greek yogurt, cherry tomato, pickled red onion, cucumber, and feta cheese wrapped in fresh and warm pita bread): A bit messy to eat as the thick pita couldn't contain all the inside goodness as I unwrapped the brown paper surrounding the sandwich, but OMG DELICIOUS. Very filling. $11\n\nExtra Yogurt Sauce: I tried all of them, Harissa, Minted, Granch and Garlic. All were good, Harissa has a surprisingly strong kick for being a little container of sauce... but the Garlic was THE BEST, I added onto the Pork Sandwich for extra delicious power. $1 each\n\nFrozen Greek Yogurt with Greek Olive Oil and Flaky Sea Salt: I was going to go with the Baklava Crumbles and Syrup version but I read another review that warned it was overpoweringly sweet. This olive oil and salt version was delicious, but weird, as I kept expecting it to taste a bit sweet because of my American programming that all yogurt is sweet. This is definitely not. It's a powerful combination of natural tastes and strong, fragrant oil with crunchy salt flakes. It is not at all delicate. Some may love it. I am on the fence ;-) $4\n\nGreek Rose wine (Skouras Zoe, Peloponnese 2014): Bottle (standard 750 ml) actually 2016 vintage for anyone who cares. Very light taste and pretty color. Went well with the food but mixing with the Garlic Yogurt Sauce was a bit of a weirdo mixer in my mouth. 12.5% alcohol. Label customized for Souvla by Diamond Importers, with Soulva's logo and a B&W photo of a happy man with salt & pepper hair and impressive 'stache . Nice touch! $18\n\nTotal: $43 without my missing fries\n\nTakeaway: Get that Avgolemono Soup and the Pork Sandwich and add extra Garlic Yogurt Sauce. YES, by Zeus!",

      "text": "Much like its cohort in Hayes Valley, Souvla off Valencia offers the same delicious menu except with EVEN MORE SEATING. The location is right in the lively and bustling Mission district and walking distance to fan favorites such as El Techo (for drinks after your filling and yummy dinner) or Dandelion Chocolate for a post dinner snack. \n\nA must try is the chicken salad \"greek style\" which means a handful crispy fries stacked on top of your crisp and refreshing salad which is more than filling. \n\nThe sandwiches are also great and very filling!\n\nIf you have room for dessert you can't go wrong with any of their delicious frozen greek yogurts, they have flavors such as baklva or olive oil and sea salt!",

      "text": "I used to be so obsessed with Souvla that I would eat it at least once a week (AT LEAST). Out of the 3 locations, this is my favorite. It's in the heart of the gentrified part of the Mission, but there's somehow always still seating available (unlike Hayes Valley where you literally have to stalk people for a spot). Love sitting outside on a nice day and people watching, too! \n\nMy favorite is the sweet potato salad - it's hearty and filling without being heavy. I can usually save half of it for the next day's lunch too, which I think justifies the $13 price tag. I'll usually share the fries with my companion(s) and dip it in the \"granch\" dressing that I order on the side from the salad, so you don't pay the ridiculous extra $1 for a few tablespoons of sauce. They're crisp and hot every single time! \n\nThe baklava Greek yogurt is an absolute treat, too, and TOTALLY worth the consequences of my moderate lactose intolerance. The yogurt is thick and tart but the honey and baklava crumbles add some sweetness. \n\nDespite all the trendy restaurants constantly popping up in the Mission, Souvla will forever be one of my regular dinner spots!",

      "text": "This review is just on the Greek Yogurt. They have food-food here too though, like wraps and salads!\n\nTheir Greek Yogurt comes in a huge cup, and can be had with a variety of toppings. My 2 other friends and I shared the Baklava Crumbles & Honey Syrup. We just came from a huge meal, so us 3 sharing one was definitely more than enough. If you're coming with a not-so-full stomach, I definitely can see 2 people sharing one order.\n\nThe Baklava crumble was cinnamon-y and very sweet, but paired with the tart and creamy greek yogurt, it cuts the sweetness a bit. However, as big as my sweet tooth is, even I thought the baklava was a little too sweet. The texture of the crumble was kind of paste-like, so it wasn't all that mixable. Nonetheless, I thought the yogurt as a whole was pretty good. The star is definitely the greek yogurt. It wasn't icy at all, and had the right amount of tartness to it.\n\nI'd give it around 3.8 stars because it lacked a bit of a WOW factor, but it was still really good! Maybe if I tried some of the other toppings I'd bump it to a full on 4. Definitely a unique dessert in the area!",

Went in today to get our usual favorite order, and when we went to leave, we didn't notice part of our order was missing: just a side of fries and dip. We go back after our picnic to ask for our missing fries, as my daughter still wanted them, and we received them, but when my daughter politely asked also for the dip we paid for, as said on the receipt, my YOUNG DAUGHTER WAS HUMILIATED AND BERATED by an extremely rude server who insinuated she was lying about a missing sauce, which we could prove was paid for on the receipt. We had ordered and paid for the sauce and DID NOT received it and we're simply asked for what we paid for. My teenage daughter was humiliated and cried after the treatment from servers in the restaurant and on the way home. We had never had an experience like this from customer service after going to Souvla for years as a family favorite restaurant. We will not be paying for this rude customer service ever again.",

There's no easier way to describe the bright ambiance and the delicious Greek-inspired food at Souvla--their simple menu of pita sandwiches, salads, and sides is simply gourmet! Coming in for lunch, I had the lamb salad, which came with juicy chunks of lamb leg over greens and kale with a harissa-yogurt sauce, cucumber, radish, pickled red onion, and tons of feta cheese! The dressings were already mixed well with the greens, and the flavors simply exploded--the pop and acidity of the red onions along with the crunch of the cucumber and the saltiness of the feta and yogurt sauce worked so well in combination! I also had the chicken salad, made with juicy rotisserie chicken over fennel, navel orange, pea shoots, pickled red onions, and mizithra cheese. The sweetness of the orange along with the crunch and earthiness of the fennel and pea shoots came together perfectly. It might seem hard to get excited about salad, but the way Souvla does its food is absolute genius.",

The chicken was also really flavorful and hit the spot. The pita wrap was also soft and just what a pita should be. My complaint, for $12 I am expecting more food and variety. The oranges in the sandwich, however, were perfect as well.",

      "text": "Really bad food & service. Came in at 8pm on a Thursday night, location was not busy.\n\nFirst time visiting, we ordered a pork sandwich, lamb sandwich, fries, and a beer ($42.00 w/ tip). All disappointing, but what should have been the highlight of the meal, the roast pork and lamb, was downright awful. In fact, the meat tasted foul and old - a little worried about food poisoning, but likely just poor quality. I'd guess that they roast meat in the nice rotisserie out front then take it back and let it sit for an hour or so, chop it into cubes, and stash it in a heated food prep tray where it dries out until served. The result is dry, old-tasting meat, but maybe doesn't explain the foul taste.\n\nOn top of that, fries came out cold. Feels like all the food is kept under heat lamps for a long time or maybe timing is just really bad.\n\nThe cashier was pretty icy and a little rude but I wouldn't have noticed as much if the food made up for the attitude.\n\nMy mistake ordering the 'greek' beer, can't hold that against them.",

We came a third time the next day.  \n\nThe ambiance is great and service is quick. Evenings are fun, as a bunch of people grab a glass of wine or glass of Greek beer while enjoying some of their food. We really wish there was somewhere like this in LA. \n\nThe value of the meal was good and will definitely come back next time we are visiting SF to try the other meats since they unfortunately do not let you sample any of the meats.",

At this place they're happy to take your order (and your money) and then leave you milling about, stalking tables, guessing which people look like they are about to leave so you can try to sit before your meal arrives. Spoiler: you end up having your food delivered while you're standing awkwardly next to the bar with nowhere to eat it. And then once someone takes pity on you and offers you their seat, the food is cold. Once you're halfway through a bland salad with cold, dry lamb a waiter comes over and gives you the dressing that was supposed to be in the salad in the first place.\n\nThis place is just around the corner and I would rather travel to the other side of the city than wait for a seat at this place again.",

He answered shortly with a cold stare \"No.\" We kindly pointed to the outside table or asked if we can then cancel the order and do dine in instead (since we put in the order less than 5 minutes ago and the food was not prepared). No friendliness, no customer service vibe, just a cold \"No you can't.\" Then eventually looked super reluctant and with the same cold stare told us we are allowed to sit outside. \"Just an exception for you but normally no\". We didn't mind the policy at all, if you really can't accommodate us there are a million ways where that can be communicated without making your customers feel super awkward and uncomfortable.

      "text": "These guys just opened up yesterday. I didn't know they had other businesses in NoPA and Hayes Valley until I looked them up to write a review.\n\nThe space was very bright with lots of colorful tile and a good amount of tables. The also had a long counter which I appreciate since I usually dine solo at lunch. There was a glass window to see all the meats actually roasting too.\n\nMy co-worker went on their opening yesterday and suggested coming in. Today I went with a buddy during a rainy lunch. We both ordered the lamb sandwich which is served a decent sized piece of pita bread. The meat was a mix of juicy and somewhat dry pieces of meat but there were a lot of fresh tasting condiments in the sandwich liked pickled onions, yogurt, cucumber, and radish. The pita was a little on the tough side and I have a thought on that.\n\nSo my buddy ordered right before me and to his sandwich within a couple of minutes. So I figured I'd get mine in the same time since I ordered right after him. But I had to wait a good 10 minutes until my sandwich was ready. They did apologize and said there was a huge order that came in but I believe that affected the pita since it wasn't that warm and that's why it was on the tough side. It'd must make more sense to kick out the small order before the large one.\n\nIt was a bummer because my buddy was in a rush and my order made him on the late side. Finally, it wasn't cheap. The sandwich came out to $14+ with tax I didn't get a real value here.\n\n I'll definitely give it another try and I hope I they work out the kinks from the first days of being open.",

I should've passed on the 250mL pour of rose ($11) but what's a Sunday brunch day without a drink? Even though I was pretty stuffed, I just had to make room for the baklava crumble & honey frozen Greek yogurt ($5). I already had my eyes set on it at the start of my meal. We grab the frozen Greek yogurt to go and headed towards Dolores Park nearby. Food was delicious, the line moves quickly, and there's plenty of seating. For a pay at the counter type restaurant, it's a bit on the pricey side but overall it's a delicious healthy alternative in the Mission District.",

      "text": "I finally got a chance to come by Souvla for dinner Sunday night. My fiance and I each ordered a chicken sandwich. We also shared a side of greek fries and a frozen greek yogurt. \nThe chicken sandwich was a spin on the traditional gyro. The pita bread they used as the wrap was quite thick. There were a lot of healthy fillings, including oranges and pea shoots. The chunks of chicken were pretty big but too dry for my taste. I felt like there could have been more dressing too. I added hot sauce to almost every bite to get everything more moist. The sandwich would have met expectations of a healthy, light meal. (3/5)\nThe greek fries were well seasoned (olive oil, lemon juice, parsley, and cheese) and the perfect crispness without sacrificing the fluffy potato insides. I did not taste the lemon though and the cheese was not overpowering. (4/5)\nThe frozen greek yogurt is the thing to come to Souvla for. We chose baklava crumbles and honey syrup. The greek yogurt itself is just slightly sour. It was very creamy and smooth without feeling heavy. The baklava crumbles had a nice chewiness and the honey syrup was just sweet enough. The two sweets on top of the greek yogurt made it all taste just right. I definitely recommend getting one of the frozen greek yogurts! (5/5)",

Being that it's extremely popular, the lines usually win over and we choose another restaurant. \n\nWe happened upon this Mission location with literally no line so we decided to give it a go. \n\nBoth of us ordered the lamb wrap and a side of the fries to share and honestly everything was just OKAY. \n\nNothing was very seasoned, felt like healthy good quality food but was truly lacking in the flavor department. Even the dipping sauces that came with the fries were bland. Now I may be use to a more traditional mediterranean or greek seasoned lamb or gyro meat, but this just felt under seasoned.  \n\nI'd recommend this place if you do not enjoy traditional spices in greek or mediterranean food  and you want a simplified flavor profile of meat, pita, and some veggies.",

It is a very small space so I can see it getting packed at lunch/brunch time. I ordered a wildflower honey yogurt. The yogurt itself was okay- Rich and creamy, not tart enough though. And then a ton of honey was poured on it. The honey was extremely thick which made it hard to eat the yogurt as the spoon would constantly get stuck to the honey. When I ordered it, I was thinking that the honey would be  inside the yogurt and not poured on top of it. And even if you are going to pour it on the top, reduce the quantity.",

Chicken - great rotisserie chicken lightly seasoned - can be chalky though at times they way it is cooked!\n\n2. Lamb - Well seasoned lamb, but often can be just slightly tough\n\n3.

I basically rotate between the chicken, pork, and lamb. The meat is always amazing, and there's a lot of greens and other fun accoutrements. I love the oranges that come with the chicken salad so sometimes I even ask for them when I order the pork or lamb salads. They go better with the chicken for sure (not sure why), but I will take any opportunity you give me to combine sweet & savory.\n\nI primarily order for pickup, and I appreciate that they let people picking up skip the line.\n\nSouvla hits the mark on my primary criteria for food:\n- Tasty\n- Convenient & Fast\n- High protein : carb ratio\n- Cost\n\nOn the cost front, some might say $12-14 for a salad is not particularly cheap, but this is San Francisco so what are you gonna do.\n\nThank you Souvla for being incredible!!",

      "text": "Tasty fast casual Greek food in the Mission!\n\nMet with friends for lunch here on a recent weekend, and I was pleasantly surprised. I guess there's a lot of hype with this restaurant, and after visiting I'll say that I'm a believer. The food is delicious! The menu is pleasantly simple: just choose a type of meat (pork, chicken, lamb, or veg) in your choice of either a sandwich or salad. Queue up to order and pay, receive a number to bring to your table, and the waitstaff will deliver your food.\n\nI got a lamb sandwich, which comes with harissa-spiked yogurt, cucumber, radish, pickled red onion, and feta cheese wrapped in soft, warm pita bread. Add some of their hot sauce (you can be liberal, it's not that spicy) and you're set. Despite being pretty crowded, we eventually found some space at their outdoor high table. Since it was hot out, I ordered their Greek iced tea to go with my meal. Refreshing! Some friends enjoyed their Souvla Greek beer, which came in a blue glass bottle. Cool. To finish off the experience, I fell back in line after the meal to order a frozen Greek yogurt with olive oil and sea salt. It was interesting and different, something I hadn't tried before. It was quite good, but I found myself fiending for their baklava crumble and honey syrup version to really satisfy my sweet tooth. Perhaps next time, I would definitely come back again. Give em a try if in the area!",

The salad is a very generous portion; I can't finish it all in one sitting, so I ask for a box and munch on it later in the afternoon. It saves pretty well, too because of the kale - not soggy.

Great that they have Greek wines and beers and even Loux soda from Greece! \n\nAs for the food, the Greek fries were crispy, flavorful, and perfectly seasoned and the salad was tasty. The sandwiches not so much. \n\nWe had one pork and one lamb sandwich. The pork was ok, not much seasoning to contribute flavor. The lamb was dry and seemed over cooked and I couldn't detect any seasoning. And the advertised harissa yogurt sauce was a tiny dribble at the bottom of the wrap. It was well garnished with various veggies and cheese, but that didn't make up for it. The most disappointing thing was the pita. It was cold and tasted like raw flour. In Greece they brush on some olive oil and grill the pita, and that would make all the difference. \n\nThat said, the place was packed at 7:30 on a weeknight.",

Both who ordered the salads were very happy.  Fresh ingredients, tasty, vibrant greens and lemony dressing.  The pickled onions and cheeses.... yum. I'll address the meat at the end of the review. Tangy yogurt with baklava and honey as well as the sour cherry sauce version were both winners.  The roasted potatoes in chicken drippings got mixed reviews.  The sandwiches were unremarkable mainly due to the dry and bland meat fillings.  It's hard to mess up lamb, but they sure did.  The salad perfection was diminished by the meat quality.  Since this is a mainstay of this restaurant, the failure was perplexing and stark.  After coming here, I completely understand both the 5 and the 1 star reviews I read before coming here.",

They're expensive but we live in SF and the quality of the food (except the soup) is good, portions are filling, and the staff is friendly. \n\nCons: The avgolemono soup contains a couple of skimpy pieces of chicken and two tablespoons of mushy rice for $6 so skip it. The roast potatoes are eh and make me daydream about real Greek lemon potatoes. The food tastes flavorful but not specifically salty going down, but I am always guzzling water a couple of hours after eating there, so it's salty. It is not authentically Greek: all the flavors are watered down, less potent and flavorful, and the meat is lean. The fact that they call the food Greek, have black and white photos of an old Greek Marlboro man, and fake NY bodega coffee cups insults my intelligence but it seems \"fake\" authenticity is trendy.",

I came here on the weekend at 6 and thankfully, my friends and I grabbed the last table before it got jammed pack. \n\nThe way this restaurant works is you order at the front first and then they give you a number and you can go and find a table. So maybe have a friend grab a table first while you order if it looks kind of busy--this way you'll for sure have a table to eat later, instead of standing. I love how you can either order what you want in a \"sandwich\" (looks like a wrap) or a salad. I got the lamb salad and an order of fries, but the cool thing here is they actually have an option where you could add in some fries to the salad as an extra topping to \"make it greek\" My salad was huge that I could not finish it. My sister ordered the chicken salad, also with an order of fries, while my friends ordered a lamb salad, wrap and chicken lemon soup. The soup was not for me because it was kind of tart. But the chicken salad was amazing. Normally, I don't like fruits in a salad or sweets mixing with savory because it throws off my entire pallet, but I tried a bite of her salad with and w/o the orange slices and it definitely tasted alot better with the fruits\n\nThe greek style frozen yogurt with baklava is a must try! I really wanted to try the Olive oil and honey lavender as well, but I was way too full at this point to engorge into 2 froyos. This was my first time trying baklava and it was super chewy and I felt like I was eating a thanksgiving pie--which I loved! Down in the center, they added honey to make the frozen yogurt even more flavorful. \n\nI will definitely be coming back to try their other froyos and salads!",

I got the veg salad and added the lamb (a Greek staple which I felt confident- maybe overly so - would be good). The majority of the ingredients seemed pretty fresh but they neglected to add any of their spicy yogurt sauce and the lamb was disgusting - grey, chewy, and completely without flavor. Apparently they are known for their chicken and, had I known this, I would have gone for that instead. Uncertain if this was a product of the to-go order, the location, or simply bad ordering on my part but I will not be going back any time soon",

I've been to another location once before just for their frozen Greek yogurt which was one of the better ones I've tried other than Fraiche in PA; tastes like actual yogurt and not over sugared milk. Now I avoid gluten and dairy so I had to make modifications to my order, but I don't think I was missing much. We got a lamb salad, a chicken salad, and shared an order of the Greek fries without cheese. All were pretty tasty; I was surprised how good the fries were considering the size of them because they were almost as big as steak fries and I am not a fan. The chicken was much juicier and had more flavor than the lamb, but I just wish they included some of the chicken skin so we could taste more of the seasoning. Next time I'd be willing to try the $20 whole rotisserie chicken with sides cause that seems like a better deal.",

Of course the hot sauce was extra cost..  All in $15 for a wrap. I say eat in because the place has cool atmosphere so maybe then it would feel like a good value. I get it these fast casual places are how restaurants are making money now in SF.  It is hard to make a go of it in this town so more power to them.  I'll probably be back but more cooking at home in my future...",

The food menu is pretty straight forward with 4 meat/veg options which you can have as a wrap or a salad as well as some side options.  I tried Mary's Free Range Chicken as a wrap which was filled with tasty chicken, pickled red onion, pea shoots, crumbled mizithra cheese and to top it all: pieces of navel orange which gave the sandwich a burst of freshness and sweetness.

      "text": "Maybe I had too high expectations for a first timer, but I did not enjoy the pork shoulder sandwich. The biggest let down was that it was served between room temperature and cold. There was no flavor at all in the pork and it was just overall sad. My friend who ate here previously (and ordered the same) said she agreed it was a let down and that the chicken sandwich she had last time was better. Also ordered the fries which were mediocre but at least it was warm. Maybe they gave us pre-made sandwiches. Came during dinner time, seats were 3/4 full and a lot of people ordered to go but there wasn't much of a dinner rush. I will come at least one more time to try something different. Hopefully the next sandwich comes out at a higher temperature.",

Not to mention the texture....revolting. I turned to my friend, we swapped sandwiches, and after a second bite, they ended up where they belonged: the trash can.

Regardless, it was a very satisfying experience from start to finish. I agree with the other reviewer who mentioned packaging. It's sleek and functional and makes a great first impression. More importantly, all of the food was delicious. We ordered the chicken salad, the vegetarian sandwich, the lemon chicken soup, a side salad and some pita bread. The flavors and textures in every dish were excellent. Imaginative combinations of ingredients and generous portions put Souvla way ahead of the competition. Everything tasted fresh and not at all heavy. Even the pita bread was unusually soft and tasty. We did something we rarely do and also ordered two sodas, the Greek orange soda and the Greek sour cherry soda. They were great. Not too sweet and no high fructose corn syrup. We will absolutely order from Souvla again and look forward to visiting them in person. For those considering Delivery, the food arrived a few minutes earlier than the projected time, and the driver was friendly and courteous. It was one of the smoother deliveries we've had in a long time, and we order in a lot.",

I finally tried the Valencia location last week, and was very disappointed. I ordered the pork salad and chicken sandwich for pickup through Souvla's website. I arrived before my order was ready, and actually saw my food coming out of the kitchen, so I was expecting a delicious fresh dinner. However, both items were cold. The sandwich didn't have that warm melt-in-your-mouth feeling that I love about their chicken sandwich, and the bread was not soft. The food wasn't *bad* but it just wasn't the high quality I'm used to from Souvla. I usually believe that Souvla's prices are justified, but with my experience at the Valencia location, my food definitely wasn't worth the price I paid. I was expecting to become a regular at this location, but I don't think I'll be coming back.",

We ordered take out and they charge $0.25 per cutlery set so I would not recommend doing that. \n\nWhat we ordered:\n- Frozen Greek Yogurt (Baklava Crumbles and Honey) [4/5] - $8 this was by far the best thing that we tried! The frozen greek yogurt was delicious, tart and a little sour. The baklava crumbles were really just a large piece at the top. I didn't really taste the honey but it was great none the less. \n- Lamb Salad [2/5] - $17 This was very disappointing. There was large amounts of kale, lettuce and very little dressing. What dressing was present, had no flavor and it was barely enough to coat the leaves. The lamb chunks were dry and a little unpleasant. It was entirely underwhelming.\n- Greek Fries [2/5] $5 - The greek fries did not carry any special flavor like described in the menu and were essentially plain fries with no sauce. \n\nI am glad that I got the chance to try Souvla, however I would only return for the frozen greek yogurt.",

The Greek frozen yogurt with baklava crumbles and syrup is a must-try! The baklava is super sweet with honey, and the yogurt is velvety, creamy, and unsweetened. The sweetness from the honey and baklava perfectly supplements the tanginess of the yogurt. It's big enough to share with a friend, and definitely worth the price.\n\nThe service is quick and attentive, and the staff is very nice and friendly. The Retsina is also great, though it's more of an acquired taste. This is the only place I can find it, so that's also fun. However, while the salads are fresh and packed with flavor, the sandwiches are a bit small and expensive, so I would suggest definitely eating in and getting the yogurt. The fun industrial aesthetic and outdoor seating area also make for a great ambiance.",

The lamb was dry and stringy, with less filling than I had hoped, the salad would've been a better option so that was disappointing. My partner got the vegetable salad which was good, but the side of Greek fries really threw me off, they taste like bland fries you reheat in the freezer, there was no flavor. Plus it's an +1 up charge for ketchup, aioli, or whatever sauces you want, as if the small cone of $6 fries wasn't enough? Plus on a cold night they don't even offer hot water, just room temp water that you pour out of a spigot? \n\nThis used to be a nice fun spot with affordable yummy Mediterranean food, but I think I'll have to pass in the meantime",

The chicken salad with romaine, kale, and pickled red onions is my favorite, but the Veg Salad is also a must-try. It's roasted to perfection with a sweet and tangy dressing. I always get the fries as well. \n\nSouvla's Greek yogurt and honey soft serve is a real treat. It's rich and creamy with a subtle sweetness that perfectly balances the tanginess of the yogurt. It's the perfect way to end a meal.\n\nService is quick and efficient, and I like the convienience of ordering first then sitting down. Price is a little high for salads but is reasonable for the amazing quality of the food.\n\nHighly recommend giving it a try!",

This place you end up ordering, getting a number and then someone giving the food which is awesome. We ended up getting:\n\n* chicken wrap - this was delicious and had chicken, feta and these yummy tangerine things which was awesome. At first it was a little dry but as I kept eating the tangerine and sauce in it made it really juicy\n\n* fries with a side of harissa sauce - this was delicious and crispy, I loved every bite fully\n\nOverall the food is reasonable, good portions and for a healthy yummy meal this is a good spot to go to.",

When you order at the counter, they make the yogurt right in front of you so you don't have to wait for it at all. \n\nOrdered the baklava crumbles and honey syrup frozen yogurt. It's a perfect size to share between two people! It was really creamy and was perfectly tart and not too sweet. The baklava with the syrup added the perfect amount of sweetness to counter the tartness from the yogurt. It was such a refreshing treat after having lunch, highly recommend stopping by just for the yogurt!\n\nThere's plenty of seating indoors, but there's also a little area to sit outside! Parking can be tough in the neighborhood, but don't let it stop you from getting a quick treat!",

I got the chicken which came with some citrus, but I think for a heartier meal, you can opt for the pork salad. They have Greek yogurt as dessert (the syrup with sour cherry was a good one). They have self-service water at a table by the counter. \n\nCredit cards accepted. Indoor and outdoor dining available. It's good for big groups. You pay first at the counter and then receive a number. Casual ambulance.",

The vegetables are obviously so fresh, the radish and cucumber was so crispy, and the pickled onions were absolutely delicious. It's by far my new favorite restaurant salad.

I like a stronger flavor so I mix in their house hot sauce too. I also appreciated the mild spice and sour taste within the hot sauce. The salad was healthy and the best part were they added orange slices. The plain Greek yogurt is great on its own because it's just sweet enough. Any topping adds a lot more sweetness to it, so if you have a sweet tooth I would recommend the baklava flavor. But I do appreciate the sour notes that have been in everything I've tried here.",

Vicious cycle.\n\nIm vegetarian so my review could affect my score. On the other hand there are plenty of non vegetarian places that i love to eat at, so you decide. \n\nI like the salad - veggie version - but its sooooo salty. Its the olives. I love olives but this is intense salt. For many years I realized that the way i ordered the salad, affected the price - i always thought that was weird. Actually its one of their members that gVe me the secret on how to order it to save a couple bucks. Then i stopped going and i forgot the secret.\n\nI have had the veggie lamb and I almost got sick. I think i have been vegetarian too long for it to pass but this is not the restaurants fault.\n\nRecently, i had a veggie kebab thing and I remembered why its hard for vegetarian. Basically the sweet potato is thick and chuncky and DRY and they dont add enough sauce.. so i ordered two sides of sauces to be able to add to the sandwich. The sandwich has a good taste but the sweet potato makes it extra \"much\" to eat. I wish they could substitute it with something else like roasted eggplant which might be less dry. I think whoever made this sandwich up did not try it.  \n\nAnyway i think everything is overpriced for what it is.. and the fries are not even good fries. It was toughly $20 for a veggie sandwich and side of fries.  \n\nI used to like their yogurt/honey. I dont think that had changed. There is nothing about this place though that makes me super excited.",

Seeing how good the rotisserie chicken was cooking in the back, I decided to get the chicken salad... but wow the chicken was so dry. The salad was also dry and lacked dressing. The kale was too bitter, they probably did not prep it enough. The orange in the salad was also bitter and not fresh. So disappointed because it looked so good when they served it to me.

Just charge more for it. \n- Leave the chicken skin on. Idk why ordering rotierrie chicken meant not having the best part which is the skin. Thats where most of the flavor comes from. What are yall doing with the leftover skin? Throwing it in the trash? Cause I did not see it on the menu. \n- The hot sauce is not hot at all. It was very very mild. I really wanted to kick it up a notch but nothing was happening. \n- Go lighter on the dressing. Way too much dressing on the salad, no kale was left undressed. \n- Add some tomatoes and/or olives to balance out the salad. \n\nMaybe if the price wasn't so high, I'd go easier but it honestly tasted like a chicken salad I could get from trader joes or something (and I love TJ but they don't charge $18 for a salad yaknow?). For the price point, there's so much better places to spend money. I really wanted to like this place and was looking forward to some healthy affair but I don't get the hype.",

But I have to say, it's not for everyone because my friend who was with me tried it too and hated it because it's not the usual greek yogurt she expects. \n\nThe texture is thick, creamy and rich which is very satisfying as a mid day snack or as a refreshing dessert. The yogurt itself is not too sweet, tart and with the olive oil, it's something new to my palette but I like this combo a lot! Definitely a new and unique experience! I recommend trying a bite as is first with the olive oil drizzled on top of the yogurt, and then mix it and try another bite! \n\nIf you are more of a sweet tooth and want something more sweet and \"safe\", then definitely get the yogurt with Baklava Crumbles & Honey Syrup which is equally delicious :)",

I will say that the Lamb pita is my favorite with the juicy potatoes (dip them in Granch). \nThe Avgolemono soup is to die for and a great soup on chillier days (today happens to be a scorcher in the city so no soup for me ). \nToday was the first time I've ever seen a whole Rotisserie Chicken on the menu so I of course had to order it. Oh. My.God. It's amazing! So juicy and flavorful and maybe just became my number one rotisserie chicken beating out RT Rotisserie. Apparently they only have them until they sell out, but if you see them- don't hesitate and just get one! \nHighly recommend if you are near one of their many locations. \n\nOh and the baklava frozen yogurt is a must,too!",

Famous chain that's present in many SF districts, but this is the one I've been to the most since I live nearby. Great options for pita sandwiches or salad bowls, and the ability to make minor adjustments to your liking - I always get the sweet potato or plant-based Black Forest lamb salad bowl with olive oil dressing! You can either order in person at the counter or online through all the various food delivery service apps, and food will be prepared very quickly. This can be a disadvantage though, if you're pre-ordering and picking it up because food can get cold and if you order the fries, which I also recommend, they can get pretty soggy. \n\nThey have a few tables indoors and outdoors. For sure, get the fries to share if you eat there and you can make it a cute date by getting some Greek wine. I've had their frozen yogurt in the past, which I loved, but haven't had recently to avoid dairy. If you like the taste of Greek yogurt, definitely get that for dessert - I loved their olive oil and sea salt flavors but you really can't go wrong with any of them! I just wish they had some more dairy free options throughout the menu, I feel like i always make a lot of modifications to avoid (most of) it and think I'm missing out on some key flavor.",

So took the test next door and it was Souvla for the Good Samaritan award!\n\nBeneath the need for a restroom lay an appetite that had been deprived by back to back morning meetings. So after a trip to the Gender Neutral restroom which was so fresh and so clean a la OutKast, I proceeded to the register to place my take out order.\n\nWhat Did I Eat?\nThe Lamb Leg Sandwich aka gyro 5/5 \nWith everything on it, Harissa-Spiked Yogurt, Cucumber, Radish, Pickled Red Onion, Feta Cheese. \n\nI had another meeting coming up so without time at my leisure I had to take it to go, but upon opening this box I couldn't help but scarf down one half right away. It looks good, tastes even better!\n\nShout out to the good folks at Souvla! Great service, and great food. The menu is focused and well executed.\n\nFrom what I could tell, they stay pretty busy during the afternoon but there is a decent amount of outdoor seating as well as some indoor. I observed that a salad and a side of fries was a common order amongst patrons and a good number of folks ordering just the frozen yogurt. I plan on coming back to try desert just that because honest look on folks faces after they took their first spoon full of it said it all. Gotta try it!\n\nThanks again Souvla, I don't rate 5 stars often, but you all are well deserved in my book!",

The chicken was a tad dry and not super flavorful. The pickled veggies were very very strong, which again didn't balance well with the overall salad.\n\nI also got pita on the side, and I would STRONGLY recommend to not. It came out soggy and wet, which was honestly kind of gross. \n\nMy friend got the pork pita sandwich which was quite delicious! The flavors are much better balanced, and if I were to come back I would definitely get the sandwich.\n\nWe also got a wildflower honey frozen yogurt, and this was the winner. Rich and creamy, but with a nice tartness to balance the yogurt out. The honey solidified almost instantly so I don't think it added much. Will definitely be back for just a cup of the plain yogurt!",

      "text": "What used to be the humble Greek hole-in-the-wall nestled in Hayes Valley is now a San Francisco titan, expanding into districts like Dogpatch and amassing long lines every lunch hour. Ask any San Franciscan what Souvla is, and they'll instantly salivate while telling you it might just be the best Greek fast food that ever existed.\n\nI've ordered pretty much everything on the menu, and I can confirm that all the sandwiches are winners. Despite being a meatatarian through and through, I can attest that the veg option -a sandwich chock full of sweet potatoes, olives, and walnuts- is delightful and filling for a sandwich that's mostly carb. However, if you have no dietary restrictions, I'd definitely go with the lamb. Unlike typical lamb dishes, it lacks gaminess, but the smoky flavor is prominent and the meat is incredibly tender. Upon entry, your eyes feast on the sight of glowing rotisseries rotating colossal hunks of chicken, pork, and lamb. Truly, these rotisseries work like it's their 9 to 5 and rent is DUE, so it's no wonder why the meat comes out as succulent and mouthwatering as it does. \n\nWhile Souvla's meat dishes are their bread and butter, don't make the rookie mistake of missing out on dessert. My friends and I tried all of their frozen yogurt flavors, and I fell in love with each and every one of them - the yogurts that is. The yogurts are incredibly light, reminiscent of slightly sour Cool Whip. But, if you're not into tangy flavors in general, this might not be your thing. My friends found it too tart, but I thought it was the perfectly decadent way to end the meal. If you're in between flavors, cherry is definitely the way to go. \n\nOne visit to Souvla and you'll understand their cult following. This place is worth every Lactaid in the world. It's been 10 hours, and I'm STILL thinking about that yogurt.",

Could have been because I ordered takeout and should've had my first time\nexperience in the restaurant. \n\nGot the pork \"sandwich\" which is really a wrap. It was quite dry and honestly did not have too much flavor. I ordered fries along with it expecting them to compliment well but they were soggy and cold.\nAgain, my opinion would've been changed perhaps if I ate in person - but most restaurants don't have such a drastic change between dine-in and take-out.\n\nWoman working the counter was also rude. Shocked as she seemed nice, but I guess not! I asked if I could eat\nmy takeout inside when there were many empty tables and she rolled her eyes LOL. Not sure if I'd be back, kind of disappointing. The cooks were nice though! Had a small interaction with them :)",

When the weather is just right like this in Hayes street, Souvla's yummy and straight forward lunch menu and outdoor seating is a good option! Walk inside to order from the counter and you can get your choice of a protein as a sandwich, bowl, or salad. I got the chicken sandwich. What added to the refreshing flavor was I think an orange? It went really well with their Greek ice tea, which was sweetened with Yuzu. Yum! Definitely coming back for lunch more often.",

I would still prefer a greasy lamb gyro at 2 in the morning over this, but Soulva is definitely a healthier alternative. \n\nFrozen Greek yogurt (5/5): SO yummy!! Got 2 frozen yogurts in the span of 4 hours - that's how much I loved it! Would 100% recommend coming here just for the frozen yogurt. I've tried the Baklava Cumbles & Honey Syrup and the Plain frozen greek yogurts and they're both bangers! \n\nAll in all, Soulva is great spot for consistent Greek food & amazing frozen yogurt!",

We were here on a Wednesday early evening and there was a line, but it moved quickly and we were able to find seating indoors (they have indoor and outdoor seating). Menu is pretty straightforward, and our food came out pretty quickly. \n\nI ordered a chicken salad, my friend ordered the vegetarian sandwich, and we got a Greek fries to share. I was a little hesitant about eating salad for dinner especially since it was cold outside, but the salad was delightful and filling. The dressing was really nicely balanced, the chicken was flavorful and not dry, and the salad overall was not cold - it was room temperature, which sounds not fun to eat but it worked out better than I thought it would. \n\nThe only downside is that I live SO FAR from Souvla!! Otherwise I'd come here more often. Highly recommend!!!",

I ordered a side of the fries with their garlic sauce and I loved the Mediterranean flavors from my meal. \n\nThe one thing I was most excited for was the baklava dessert but was disappointed by the taste. The frozen yogurt is very very tart, and it does not pair too well with the baklava crumbs as it is super sweet. Some vanilla frozen yogurt would have been soooooo good with it. Nevertheless I'm so glad I got to experience this food here.",

      "text": "One of my go-to spots for a quick meal whenever I'm hanging out in Hayes Valley! I always say I'm not much of a salad girl because they never fill me up (hungry girl probs), but the salads here are always a decent portion. My usual order is the Lamb Salad and the Juicy Potatoes. The salad is nicely balanced with the pickled red onions and crunchy veggies along with chunks of lamb, and the potatoes (with rotisserie drippings!) always hit the spot. \n\nIt's also worth stopping by just for the frozen Greek yogurt--it's delicious! Tart and tangy with several toppings options that nicely complement the yogurt. I've tried the baklava crumbles & honey syrup, Greek sour cherry syrup, and the Cretan wildflower honey. Cherry is my favorite! It's nice, light, and tart whereas the baklava one is a little too sweet for me and the honey tends to harden on the yogurt and get stuck in your teeth lol. \n\nI would order the salads more often if they weren't almost $20, but I'll always make a pit stop for the frozen Greek yogurt!",

I've heard people rave about this place being a classic spot in Hayes valley so I had to try it. I came in on a slow day and feel like that gave me a better experience with the food quality! I ordered the Chicken Wrap and each ingredient I could taste tasted very fresh and homemade. The chicken itself was cooked to perfection and seasoned just right. I was a big fan of the mandarin orange inside although some reviews find that unconventional. The orange was very creative and brought all the flavors together to make the wrap taste more fresh. The pita bread was also a great addition Because it was still warm and moist. Each ingredient in this wrap did not go unnoticed and I enjoyed every component. The only disappointment was the price point. The wrap was 17 dollars which I think was steep because of the portion. Usually I'm left with leftovers from places with that price point but not a deal breaker because the food was delicious. I will be coming back to try that yogurt that everyone keeps talking about!!",

They also had a huge park-let outside with a ton of seating. \n\nI got the chicken salad which was honestly one of the best tasting salads I've ever had. Whatever they use for their dressing is bomb, and the quality of their ingredients is amazing. I would definitely order that salad again. My boyfriend ordered the pork sandwich, which I tried. Unfortunately, both of us found the pita to be chewy and tough, which was a major disappointment because I feel the pita can make or break the wrap/sandwich. If we hadn't been in a rush to get to our show, we definitely would have requested another pita because for the price point of the sandwich, the pita hands down should've been fresh and not over toasted. Again, really disappointed about the pita so one big star off for that. Despite the chewiness of the pita, the sandwich was flavorful though and the quality of the ingredients again very fresh. We also tried the fries with garlic sauce and would recommend. \n\nOverall, delicious, clean, and decent service. Willing to give them another shot with the pita, and next time definitely want to try their infamous frozen yogurt as well as other sauces/seasonings for their fries.",

The tangerine in the chicken salad refreshes the savoryness of the cheese and onions. The best part about finishing your salad is ordering their frozen yogurt for dessert. I recommend the wild honeycomb froyo if you're a honey fan. The fries are also great to eat as a side or a topping to your salad.",

They gave a generous portion of chicken and there were so many refreshing tastes in this one bowl. My favorite ingredient was the segmented oranges that added a kick of sweetness to the dish. \n\nAfter my meal, I wanted something sweet so I ordered their frozen greek yogurt and got the baklava crumbles & honey syrup flavor. It was so YUMMY. That sweetness coming from the baklava and honey really balanced out with the tartness of the greek yogurt. Highly recommend finishing your meal with this treat.

Something that did surprise me was they charge 25 cents for utensils for togo orders. This seems a little unnecessary for an already marked up salad.",

We ordered at the counter, grabbed a seat inside, and a couple minutes later we had our food. \n\nI went for the chicken sandwich and it was sooo filling. Chicken was tender, toppings were refreshing, and the \"granch\" dressing tasted great. Although the oranges in the sandwich were a little off for me. Could have gone without the side of fries for how big the wrap was but it was worth it. Crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and went great with the harissa-spiked sauce. \n\nOf course I had to the try baklava and honey Greek yogurt since that's what everyone is talking about now. As with everything else, the yogurt was huuuge. Loved the crushed baklava topping with the honey syrup. The yogurt tasted exactly like traditional greek yogurt, and the baklava brought the needed sweetness. Next time I'll ask them to put on a little extra honey syrup on top. \n\nCould tell all their food was super fresh too. They started cooking their pork shoulder in the rotisserie in the restaurant. \n\nOnly downside was the prices were a little steep. Spent upwards of $40 on the whole meal for myself. But I did leave stuffed and food tasted delicious. I'll stop by Souvla again some time soon. Eyeing the pork sandwich for next time.",

The shop is located next to the Hayes valley park so there's a lot of nice outdoor park benches/picnic tables, as well as plenty of indoor seating and patio seating. The yogurt itself is quite tart and is drizzled with honey, so it's so good for if you don't like your desserts overly sweet. If you like very sweet, you are probably better off with the baklava honey flavor! Street parking is quite difficult, but it's a nice neighborhood to walk around since there are many shops and cafes. I'll definitely return to try their other frozen yogurt flavors!!",

I now live in Hayes Valley pretty much down the street so it feels fitting to review it now. \n\nBeen getting Soulva for years now. My sister first introduced me, her and her husband absolutely love it. \n\nPretty much anything you get here is good. I particularly like the lamb (either salad or sandwich) but the pork is also good. Chicken can sometimes be dry. Never had the soft serve but it looks delicious. Think the only thing these folks are missing is some greek style meat fries -- basically what they have just served with a little extra dressing and meat on top. I've asked if they could serve the fries with meat before and they wouldn't, but can get a side of meat and fries separately. Only real reason I've thought about this is because Nick's in Redwood City where I used to live had some absolutely bangin' fully loaded Greek fries!\n\nTry it if you haven't already!",

      "text": "Souvla is an SF-based chain offering Greek-inspired salads and pita sandwiches with a distinctively Californian spin. The newest addition to the short menu was the Black Sheep Plant-Based Lamb, made of soft, savory cubes of \"lamb\" with a distinctly gamey flavor. The salad was built on a base of Tuscan kale and romaine lettuce tossed in a harissa-spiked yogurt dressing along with cucumbers, radishes, pickled red onions, pea shoots, and crumbled feta cheese. Every bite of this salad was crunchy and flavorful, and the best part was definitely the chunks of lamb. I also tried the Mary's Free Range Chicken Salad, built on the same base of kale and romaine lettuce, but accompanied with Granch (Greek ranch) dressing and topped with fennel, orange wedges, pickled red onion, pea shoots, and mizithra cheese, along with shredded rotisserie chicken. Overall, everything here was fresh and delicious, and made for a healthy, casual meal.",

We ordered a lamb salad for my fiancé, chicken on the side for me (it was really cool that they offered this since I don't really like salad or wraps), and a greek yogurt with baklava crumble. The chicken on the side was a much smaller portion than I was hoping, but I was surprised that it held so much flavor! I also wished the baklava crumble wasn't just sitting directly on top in a scoop because as I ate downwards, there wasn't any baklava towards the bottom half of the cup to complement the sourness of the greek yogurt. It was still my favorite part of our order though and I would still order it again!",

Ordered a lamb wrap with cheese on the side, Greek fries without cheese, and a frozen Greek yogurt with baklava crumbles and honey syrup.\n\nThe lamb wrap was okay. I didn't think it was too special. The lamb was seasoned and tender. Veggies were fresh, but I wish they were more evenly dispersed. The sauce could have been more spread out too and had more or it because there were portions of the wrap that were a bit drier.\n\nFries kind of just tasted like garlic fries. They got a bit soggy on the ride home, but the fries were still pretty good. \n\nThe frozen Greek yogurt was the best. I'm not typically a fan of Greek yogurt, but it was delicious. The baklava was really sweet, but it paired nicely with the tart yogurt. The baklava itself had a lot of spices, but it was on the soggy side, maybe because of the honey.\n\nI would go straight for the frozen Greek yogurt the next time.",

We got the lamb salad, lamb wrap, and soup. The soup was easily the best thing. Our lamb was extremely dry to a point where we couldn't even chew...it was like rubber for real. The salad had no flavor, the dressing was entirely bland. We had to drench the not so-hot sauce on the wrap to add some type of flavor. We definitely did get the scrapped ends of the dried lamb and left a foul taste in our mouth. I couldn't even finish my salad and left. Good food presentation though.",

      "text": "Came here for a quick dinner before attending the SF Ballet. They have tables inside and outside the restaurant. You do order first and then sit yourself. I ordered the chicken salad instead of the sandwich/wrap with a side of the fries with garlic ranch. The bowl was flavorful and a medium to large portion. I had to ask for a to-go box! Their fries were well seasoned and they gave you a perfect serving. The side dressing for the ranch was good too, it is an extra dollar tho if it is not ketchup. But definitely worth it and not the end of the world. \n\nPlace is clean, bathroom is well kept but too close to the kitchen for my taste, the staff are friendly, and there is a good ambient to the place. Overall, the size of the menu is small but honestly I think that makes for a great restaurant because they are able to perfect the meals. Definitely coming here again.",

No. Terrible value even if it tasted good. \n\nFood - Free range Chicken (Pita) \"Sandwich\" $16+\n\nTerrible price point. Objectively terrible chicken wrap. An attempted take on a modern chicken pita/gryo. Complete failure. \n\nPita: Average. Warmed on a grill. Nothing special. No flame char/additional flavor added.\n\nFillings: ~1/2 an orange worth of orange slices... Makes the entire wrap taste odd. Wasn't terrible, but didn't elevate any other part of the wrap. Such a strange choice with no benefit other than trying to be hipstery/elevated/weird. Literally tasted like you dropped some oranges on an already sub-par pita wrap.\n\n'Free Range Chicken' was shredded, dry, and lacked any real flavor. Canned Costco chicken would have been an improvement. Rotisserie Costco chicken would have been a home run.\n\nVeggies, picked onions, and yogurt sauce were present texture-wise, but were absent in the flavor department.\n\nThe fact that this was $16+ for a regular size pita wrap is the nail in the coffin. Imagine paying $10+ for a normally-sized street taco. Mediterranean food is almost always tasty AND a great value proposition. If this same wrap was $8 (1/2 price) it may have reached 2 stars. Ouch.\n\nOther:\n* Bathroom: Single, gender neutral, clean.\n* Parking: Standard tough SF street parking.\n* Inside: Clean, modern design. Nice.\n* Service: Fast casual. Nothing to complain about.",

I think if you're a fan of greek yogurt, you'll be a fan of this item. i am already naturally borderline about greek yogurt so I wasn't obsessed with it but it was still a refreshing and unique treat. I would definitely recommend at least adding honey or some sort of topping to sweeten it up! it's a great gluten free dessert but if you don't have an allergy, i've also heard great things about the baklava topping.",

They made a slight and very understandable mistake with my order and fixed it very quickly without question. There is self-serve seating inside and outside. \n\nI came specifically for the vege lamb gyro. I was so impressed with the vege lamb, tender, moist and so well seasoned. I love that they but thinly sliced radish, cucumber, pickled onion inside with feta. The combo of ingredients is incredible. The Greek fries are also delicious. \n\nI can't wait to bring my vegetarian family back here to try! I know my son will love the salad option which is packed with tons of romaine and kale.

Even though we had a late lunch (~1:30), the restaurant stayed busy throughout the afternoon, which speaks to how good it was! The food came really fast (5 mins) and we loved the aesthetic decor inside. \n\nFries (5/5): So good! Fresh and crispy and hot. We got the Granch sauce and definitely recommend -- as the name suggests, it's like a cross between ranch and Greek yogurt. \n\nPork wrap (4/5): Could have used a bit more flavor but the pork was super tender!\n\nVeg salad (3.5/5): A hearty portion of salad with lots of good mix-ins (olives, walnuts, mizithra). The white sweet potato was a bit bland, but the dressing helped tie all the flavors together. Overall not super special but the only veggie option, so I'd get it again if I were here!",

      "text": "FYI: They don't have any trash cans laying out and about (at least when we went) so if you want to throw away your finished yogurt cup, ask the staff member behind the counter\n\nWHAT WE GOT: Frozen greek yogurt (baklava crumbles & honey syrup)\n\nPROS: This dessert gets the highest of all Asian dessert compliments (\"It's not too sweet!\"). With the perfect mix of tang, a hint of sourness, and the sweetness from the baklava crumbles and honey, this froyo is super refreshing and a great way to end a night of heavier, richer eating. It feels so light that it's almost guilt free! They also give you a decent amount of froyo and toppings so it's definitely worth it.\n\nCONS: So this is where I docked 2 stars. Not necessarily because of the food we got (which was good and honestly 4-star worthy), but because of my experience here. First of all, there aren't too many indoor seating options and they only have 1 bathroom (that doesn't really look like it's cleaned too too often). If you do choose to seat yourself outside and not just do take out, just be careful of your surroundings (like with most city outdoor seating). We had an unfortunate run in with a homeless guy who harassed and threatened our group as he passed. It started off with him just asking for money, but he apparently hovered behind me and made aggressive advancing movements towards my back (according to my husband). He came back around and started threatening us, adding a few racist comments in his rambling before he walked off. This was also after I saw him walk up to one of the outdoor bench tables and drink water straight out of what looked like an old glass bottle acting as either a vase or just decor. He literally just grabbed it off the table while someone was eating their meal right next to it and took a big swing out of before putting it back on said table. I'm sorry but this whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth. I do plan on coming back eventually but maybe not for a while just to distance myself from that night a bit.",

Enjoying a hearty salad while people-watching in this lively little street made for a relaxing afternoon. \n\nI love that the menu is simple & efficient. Have your choice of protein (pork, chicken, lamb, or veggie) in one of two variations (salad or wrap). \n\nThis location drew me back for a second visit, where I shamelessly indulged in their frozen Greek yogurt w/ baklava crumbles. True to its origin, this soft serve has a tartness that balances perfectly with drizzled honey and chewy baklava.\n\nI'm a big fan of their salads-- convinced me that the \"health\" factor outweighs the yogurt I'm washing it down with. I'd say that Souvla is a solid lunch/dinner spot no matter what the occasion.",

      "text": "This place is worth the hype- though I would recommend getting a salad since the portion is a lot more satisfying than the wrap!\n\nOrder at one window and pick up at another, and they have a handful of outdoor dining seats! The service was fast and the food was fresh, savory, and filling.\n\nLamb salad- I love lamb, and the meat here is great in that it's not too gamey/chewy! The salad is a mix of kale, cucumber, cilantro, radish slices, and a feta/greek yogurt dressing. The creaminess from the cheese and dressing really goes well with the umami flavor of the lamb, and there's a good ratio of meat to salad- I was pleasantly surprised at how much lamb I had!\n\nChicken salad- a lot of flavor in the shredded chicken, I'm always a little hesitant to get shredded chicken anything because it's usually dry but this one was soaked in juices so it wasn't bad. The rest of the salad is similar to the lamb salad, except this one hd  mandarin slices mixed in which gives it a nice sweet citrus-y addition.\n\nJuicy potatoes- very soft and fatty, though not a lot of flavor like I was expecting. I'd recommend getting the Greek fries for your potato fix!\n\nNote: As of 4/6/21, their Greek fro yo machine was down and pending fix :(",

      "text": "Souvla is a SF standard. To be perfectly honestly - the first few times I had it, I really didn't get the hype. That may have to do with the fact that the vegetarian offering is a bit sub-par compared to the non-vegetarian foods. The sweet potato based dishes are definitely a bit of an acquired taste, but they've grown on me as an alternative to the perpetual Sweetgreen / Blue Barn healthy enough but has some taste genre...\n\nThe real kicker though at Souvla that has made me a fan, and entices me over and over again to fork over $14 for a sweet potato wrap is that it's an excuse to eat their delicious frozen Greek yogurt. If you like tart foods, this is the ideal dessert. I cannot tell you how many containers of Souvla frozen Greek yogurt I've hoarded in my freezer for Friday nights where you want to convince yourself that you're eating healthy, but need something indulgent (please spare me, and don't count)\n\nThe toppings that the frozen Greek yogurt comes with are all good - the sour cherry and Cretan wildflower honey are both incredible. If you're feeling really adventurous - try both on top. Best dessert in Hayes Valley imo (sorry Salt & Straw)",

I love their chicken or pork salad as well as their frozen greek yogurt with baklava crumbles & honey syrup. I highly recommend their salad because it's not just another healthy option but actually so yummy that I sometimes get cravings for it. \n\nI think I slightly prefer the chicken salad to pork salad even though both are really good just because I like the citrusy taste of the navel orange in the chicken salad that adds a refreshing taste to it. On the other hand, I thought the pork salad and lamb salad were pretty similar except for (obviously) the taste of the meat itself. But you cannot go wrong with any of their salad options! \n\nTheir frozen greek yogurt is also a MUST, especially the one with baklava. It adds a nice sweetness and texture to the dense and creamy frozen yogurt!",

      "text": "I am not convinced Souvla is worth the hype. I got a lamb salad to go, and upon first inspection it is a beautifully composed salad for takeout standards. However, the lamb was stringy and dry - it is begging for it to either be crisped up or soaked in some sort of sauce. I got a side of pita, which was dense and chewy - skip this. I think next time I'll go for the chicken and fried. Some highlights: The salad itself was refreshing and not overdressed. All the fixings were crisp and fresh. You can order online and pick up food pretty quickly. \n\nIs this Greek food? I don't think so. Are my standards way too high after having Greek food in Greece? Perhaps. But, the food was overpriced for what it is - it's a salad with maybe 3 oz of tiny cubes of overcooked lamb for $16! Although, being overpriced is maybe just because this is the reality of SF. If you are hankering for solid, authentic Greek fares, I'd say start your search elsewhere.",

The fries were really good! Perfectly seasoned and had a bit of garlic on top too. Paired very well with the yogurt dipping sauce they provided. The sandwiches however, not a huge fan. The bread was a bit tough, and my lamb tasted like carnitas. My friend got the chicken sandwich and she was not a fan of the orange slices they include in the sandwich either. Overall, a great place when you're looking for a quick bite, but maybe stick to yogurt or salad and avoid the sandwich.",

I always ordered the lamb gyro/sandwich and ended the meal with their famous frozen greek yogurt with baklava crumbles and honey.\n\nLamb Gyro/Sandwich - I like how their ingredients were simple, fresh, and tasty. I find that a lot of gyros tend be a bit heavy or oily but this one isn't. As you can see from the pictures, there are not that many ingredients but the ingredients they do include all compliment each other and are high quality. They are also very generous with their meat portions.\n\nFrozen Greek Yogurt w/ Baklava Crumbles + Honey - This is such a great dessert! The frozen greek yogurt has a nice tang to it that surprised me at first, but perfectly balances the very sweet baklava and honey. They don't skimp on the baklava either! There is more than enough to have a little baklava with each bite you eat. Again, I like how this dessert doesn't feel too heavy since the greek yogurt is light refreshing and not overly sweet.\n\nI can't say too much about the inside or the staff since I've only ordered through Caviar but I've had no complaints about my food or orders!",

But all it took was one time to get me absolutely HOOKED and now I just can't stop eating it.\n\nI always order the chicken sandwich/salad. The sandwich is basically the salad wrapped in pita, they just give you less salad. I use to worry that just getting the salad wouldn't be filling enough, but boy was I wrong. They give you a huge portion of salad and it's definitely super filling, and you can also add pita. \n\nThe chicken is the best part of the salad by far. It is just SO tender and flavorful. I seriously crave it all the time. The Greek Yogurt dressing and vinaigrette make the salad incredibly savory. I also love the addition of the pickled onions.\n\nTheir Greek yogurt is also bomb! It's the perfect creaminess and tartness. I'll get either the sour cherry (if I want something lighter), or baklava + honey syrup (which can be really filling).\n\nYes, the prices are super high, but still end up giving in every time!",

I Added the baklava and honey. \nFirst bite- the best apple pie alamode you've ever had.\nThen that pungent sour yogurt taste kicks in. Not overpowering but subtle more acidic than sour. \nSmooth and silky, very refreshing. Definitely worth a return visit.\nEarlier my son ordered us the salads with lamb. \nIt was very rich and filling while being healthy too. \nWinston insisted we share a bit of lamb with him. The smell being fragrant and all. \n\nI surmise that the combination of healthy, fresh, flavorful and not expensive are what draws the long lines, rave reviews and popularity. \nBut definitely come back for the frozen yogurt!",

Here are my reviews on certain dishes:\n\nVeg sandwich: I'm a big fan of this type of sweet potato so I really enjoyed this! My vegetarian friend got the same thing but he didn't like sweet potatoes so it wasn't great for him. I asked for no olives because I don't enjoy them so that's why the sandwich in the picture doesn't have olives.\n\nChicken sandwich: the chicken was pretty dry when I got the wrap. My friend got the salad different time we went and the the chicken was also dry that time. I would recommend the veg sandwich over this due to this. \n\nGreek fries: nice and crispy. Dipping sauce that came with it was also good. \n\nOverall, the portion sizes weren't very big and the flavors were not bad, but I probably won't come again.",

Still a good experience and try but overall an average experience. \n\n// Pork Salad \nThe salads are very colorful! I enjoyed the various different ingredients that were tossed in, like cherry tomatoes, pickled red onions, cucumbers, and feta cheese. The pork salad has a minted Greek yogurt dressing, which was light and refreshing. However, the pork was a little too dry and tough for me enjoy. The pork pieces were quite rough although they gave the salad greens a nice savory flavor. For the price, I expected a better experience. \n\n// Greek fries \nFries were very fresh and piping hot! Unfortunately, they  weren't as crisp as I usually like my fries (still too soft) and I kept waiting for the flavors to pop out more. The fries were still good but not exceptional. The flavors were mostly hidden for me so I wish the ingredients came out more! \n\n// Frozen Greek Yogurt with Cherry Syrup (not pictured)\nTook a bite of my friends and the frozen yogurt is quite refreshing! It's a great treat for a hot day. The yogurt has the perfect balance of sweet, tart, and creamy. \n\n// Store ambience and experience \nSimple walk-in ordering experience with a little pick-up window outside. Service was friendly and our orders came out in a good amount of time! \n\n// Price and value \nThe pork shoulder salads were $15 and the pork/chicken wraps were $14. A little pricey for me given that the flavors didn't pop as much as I had hoped. The ingredients were fresh but the taste was underwhelming. \n\nSouvla is still a great choice for a nice, summer day picnic! It's simple, clean, and light. The pork was too dry and hard for me but perhaps another protein option is better.",

Took forever for the food to come out. $20 for this underwhelming meal?! It's honestly not worth it.\n \nPopped in here one evening pre-coronavirus for a quick dinner. I was looking for something fast casual and from the looks of it, this place seemed to fit the bill. Soulva is small fast casual Greek food chain that has a simple-ish menu consisting of rotisserie cooked natural meats. The interior space is really inviting and comfortable. This is a total hipster joint by definition. Not normally my scene, but the vibes were super mellow. This seems like a popular hangout spot for the young folk in Hayes Valley.\n \nPrices are really high. It costed me $20 for a chicken wrap and Greek fries (no drink included). Uuumm... WHAAAT?! Just way to expensive for this type of meal. To top it off, it wasn't very good at all. The chicken in my wrap was dry AF!!! It was like they overcooked it or something. Just super dry and flavorless. There wasn't enough sauce in the wrap, and the sauce that was there didn't have much flavor either. The fries tasted okay, but they were clearly undercooked. They were definitely raw in the middle.\n \nNormally, I would have probably asked them for fries that were cooked all the way through. The reason why I didn't was because I was pressed for time and it had already taken a long time for me to get my food in the first place. For my first experience at Soulva, I was left a bit disappointed. I'm not saying that I'd never come back here again. But what I will say is that I won't be in a rush to come back anytime soon.",

The fries are large, crispy, and topped with feta, lemon, and parsley.\n\nThe salad is mostly just kale and romaine with a few radishes. Nothing special. The lamb was for the most part very tender, though about 25% of the pieces were tough, and was good. Lamb wrap is always delicious.\n\nThe customer service was excellent and the space clean.

I definitely have to say it's a good spot if you want something fast and casual but not anything mind-blowing. The frozen Greek yogurt was pretty good -- would come back again and try others to-go. Overall, would just think of this place as something healthy and fast.",

I enjoyed the Baklava Yogurt, but the Chicken Salad was pretty average. The dressing is pretty oily, and it definitely showed when I just finishing up and saw the bottom of the box. Even though the dressing softened up the kale a lot, there was just an overwhelming proportion of kale that made the whole bowl really bitter (since kale is naturally bitter). I stopped wanting to eat it halfway but didn't want it to go to waste so just pushed through. Could definitely give more chicken as well. I'll probably go with the wrap next time instead.",

I will say Souvla is really clean and consistent and has a great ambiance so there is a lot of like. But I just like more flavor to my Mediterranean food. I found Souvla to be a bit bland. Their Greek fries are dank though! \n\nMy favs:\n- Chicken salad\n- Greek fries\n- Baklava Crumbles & Honey Syrup Yogurt",

You order at the front and they bring you your order on these white/ceramic  trays to match the theme they have throughout the spot.\n\nI got the Avgolemono  (sp!) soup which is a creamy, lemony soup with chicken and rice. So delicious. My other was the lamb sandwich which was filling and i saved half for a later snack.\n\nI give this spot 4 stars because it was quite expensive considering the amount. I wouldn't have thought I'd have to pay $20+ for a soup and sandwich but I guess that's SF prices?! (I've lived in NYC for 7 years and that doesn't even compare...)",

It wasn't too sweet -- it honestly reminded me of the \"tart\" flavor you can get at many froyo places, just creamier in texture -- and the honey on top adds just the right amount of sweetness and flavor. Definitely a fantastic guilt-free dessert! \n\nIf I was just rating my salad here, I'd probably give this place 3 stars, but the frozen yogurt was truly fantastic so I'll give it 4 stars :)",

Now I know that I always have to order my own. \n\nSince then, I became so addicted to that it's a must have whenever I visit SF!!!  Wish they would open a Souvla in Monterey so I can preach about it to my local people!!!!   \n\nTheir salads are also phenomenal! I always usually get the chicken salad with French fries and it's such a filling and delicious meal. The salads are huge so they can easily feed two people. The workers are also nice enough to split one order into two to go if you ask. \n\nGoodbye till next time Souvla! I will miss you more than I miss my daughters living in San Francisco!",

The olive oil and sea salt was so delicious!!! The baklava and honey was ok .. it was a huge piece of baklava with the honey already in it. It was fine but the baklava tasted more like a chewy oatmeal cookie then traditional baklava to me .  \n  \n\nI would definitely return for some more frozen yogurt here and perhaps some food as well.

I don't think I'd order it again (I definitely want to try the baklava one) because the cherry syrup was a bit too sour for my liking. I know it says \"sour\" right in the name, but I absolutely love cherry flavor, so I had to at least try it. The yogurt itself was also a bit lacking in flavor, it basically tasted like \"plain\" frozen yogurt (as opposed to vanilla), though I suppose that might have been what it was. \n\nOverall, a great restaurant with great service. There are some public tables right in front of the restaurant which were available when I went, so you can eat it there or take it to-go.",

      "text": "We were really pleased with our food and experience. The menu is small, we ordered at the counter and our food was brought to us shortly. I ordered a salad with lamb. It was fresh with romain lettuce, kale, pickled red onions, feta cheese, coated in a vinaigrette. The lamb was plentiful, tender and tasty. It was a large, satisfying salad. For dessert I had the Greek yogurt soft serve with sour cherry sauce. The soft serve was tangy and cheesy in flavor with just a hint of sweetness. My dinner cost $23 plus tax a tip, a good deal by SF standards. Looking forward to eating there again.",

      "text": "I have been meaning to try Souvla for the longest time and I finally had my chance! \n\nThe process is super simple and fast and service was very nice and helpful. We chose to get Pork and Lamb Sandwiches, pita, and an extra garlic yogurt sauce to-go.\n\nBetween the sandwiches, I preferred the lamb over the pork only because it seemed to offer more flavor (I guess the gaminess) and less oil. The pork sandwich was laying in a puddle of its own grease. \n\nThe sandwiches overall were both super stuffed, almost too much to the point of being difficult to eat. I'm glad that it's plentiful! \n\nI didn't think much of the pita side, but I loved the garlic yogurt sauce. Extremely garlicky, almost hot! So perfect as a dipping sauce, I thoroughly enjoyed it with my sandwich. \n\nOverall a good experience. I would love to go back to try their salads and their green yogurt, it seemed like more people opted for those vs what I ordered!",

      "text": "This place is the perfect quick option for lunch or dinner. They're usually pretty busy so I recommend ordering online - it's usually ready in 15 mins or less. However that speed can also have a downside - sometimes the food is prepared right away even when I schedule the order for later, which is a bit frustrating as the pita gets tough and fries get soggy while it's sitting there. \n\nI've tried pork, chicken, and lamb in both sandwich and salad form, and I think my favorite is the pork sandwich. Chicken sandwich/salad is a close second, but when I had the lamb it was super dry and not too flavorful. Maybe it was just a bad batch? The fries are also awesome, although as mentioned above they have a tendency to get a little soggy for delivery/pickup orders. I recommend trying those fresh if you can.",

      "text": "My friends raved about Souvla. Its a fast casge place in SF and we arrived at this once. We ordered online and when we arrive (like 4 mins after) our order was ready. I ordered the lamb Salad Greek style. The mix was a combo of what I could notice as kale and other vege. Tons of bites of lamb and topped with fries. I wasn't overly impressed but it was...fine. The salad was just a salad and even with the dressing, it was still a salad that didn't have that POW! The lamb was a bit dry and although flavorful, it wasn't very impressive. The fries obvi were easy to scarf down but as a whole, it's meh. I think if I were to come back, I'd do the pork or vege options and choose a sandwich instead. I hear the baklava yogurt dessert is bomb so maybe I just need to come here for that.",

I also took a few scoops of my friend's baklava and honey flavor. For some reason, it just didn't hit the same as when I initially got it. I think they were skimping on the toppings and the baklava was kind of mushy. Sour cherry syrup was interesting and tasty but I felt like it was missing another texture component like how the baklava acts as a granola.",

Seating is first come, first serve. Then the food will be delivered to your table. The restaurant isn't too big so it may be hard to find seating at peak hours. \n\nI ordered the Salad with Mary's Free-Range Chicken to share with a friend since we both weren't too hungry. The salad was very fresh and definitely not boring at all! The chicken was perfect. I enjoyed the navel oranges, fennel, and pickled red onions in the salad. Everything went so well together. It was probably one of the best salads that I have ever had. I thought the portion was definitely enough for two people. We also ordered a side of the Greek Fries. The toppings on the Greek Fries were amazing and the fries were cooked perfectly. \n\nBut my favorite thing about this place was the Frozen Greek Yogurt!!! I did notice a lot of people ordering at the counter was just getting the Frozen Greek Yogurt to go. We ordered the Baklava Crumbles & Honey Syrup one because that was what the staff recommended. The Baklava was a little too sweet for me though. The frozen Greek yogurt was yummy. It was not too sweet and just perfect. I do want to try the Greek Olive Oil & Flaky Sea Salt next time. If you're in the city, you should stop by and check out this place, or at least grab a frozen Greek yogurt to go!",

I'm not a connoisseur of this type of cusine, but I know when it's supposed to be good. I like eating cultural foods when you can taste not only the authenticity of the food. But you can taste the effort and the love that is put into the food to make it an experience. I didn't get that here, if anything I left feeling unsatisfied. IDK, this place missed the mark for me in a lot of areas, and now I will proceed to tell you why \"Souvla\" isn't memorable..\n\n\"Souvla\"\nLocation - San Francisco, Ca (Hayes Valley)\nFood - Mary's Free Range Chicken (Sandwich), Greek Fries\nPrice - $20.50 (Before Tax), $22.27 (After Tax)\n\nSouvla:\nThis establishment is a little greek/mediterranean styled eaterie in the \"Hayes Valley\" area of San Francisco. Being the size that it is and of course the times we're living in at the moment. The have limited indoor seating with avaliable \"Parklet\" seating outside for those that want to dine right away. Sitting on a popular street with small tapas eatablishments and little bars. The area \"Souvla\" definately seems to be hip and kinda trendy. Having never been to this area much on my SF excursions (don't judge me) I was at first delighted to take the road less traveled for me and to try something completely new for me as well. I went with a friend of mine and he suggested \"Souvla\" because he said the food was light and healther than my usual choices. I decided to take him up on his word and pay this place a visit, of course after looking at the rest of the \"Yelpire\" had to say about this establishment. Let me tell you what I thought of what I ordered..\n\nMary's Free Range Chicken (Sandwich) $15.50 - This was more of a pita wrap than a typical sandwich. They offer pretty much the filling of this wrap in a salad form as well for $1 more. This sandwich wrap consisted of  Granch (Greek Yogert/Ranch) dressing, Fennel, Navel Orange, Pickled Red Onion, Pea Shoots and Mizithra Cheese (Almost like Feta) and I have to say this was a lackluster sandwich. Very bland, but also light....considering the ingredients of course. Like everything would of meshed so much better if everything paired up and had come flavors. The price of this sandwich may seem steep, but everything they serve here is for the most part locally sorced and or from substanable sources in the Bay Area. The size was nice, but it felt like I wasn't eating anything with flavor. The sometimes bold in your face flavors that Greek/Mediterranean food tend to have was missing here....like the deserts miss the rain. Kinda a letdown.\n\nGreek Fries - $5.00 - Well for being fries, I have to say they were pretty good, like they weren't anything too special be any means, but they were simple and..good. Fries, not too many people I know that don't like them in some way shape of form. These were tossed in some olive oil, parsley, and mizithra cheese crumbles. Just enough to coat them and this was more flavorful than the sandwich in my opinion, it was an okay amount for the price. I wasn't upset by these or the \"Granch\" dressing they gave you on the side for dipping. \n\nOverall:\nThe shortcommings of \"Souvla\" really came in form of the service for me, especially the woman that was working the front, IDK if she was a manager or just an unpleasant person, but she was pretty rude and blunt. I will note my visit was slightly before reopening, but SF being in the Yellow Tier at the time and the more foot traffic must have been annoying for her. If she huffed and puffed anymore than what she was doing, should of would blown the house down. Not a good look, bad first impression and a lasting one that makes me say I will not visit \"Souvla\" again. Bland Food and Bad Service is a No from me Dawg!!",

They've handled the transitions with Covid-19 well, they have a very efficient contactless ordering system. I've had the Lamb wrap, chicken wrap and chicken salad with fries several times now and cannot recommend them enough. Well seasoned, pillowy chewy wrap, crispy well seasoned fries and the garlic aioli?? Yes. Do it. They've been consistent over the last 2 years and I appreciate that. Even when they're not that busy or there's a group of 8 ppl waiting, food has been good. And you MUST MUST have their frozen yogurt. Tangy, lightly sweet and creamy. I am team baklava :)  nice time to go because there's actually parking these days! My friend and I ate our food in the car since there's no outdoor dining and then ordered the frozen yogurt. Best meal in my car hands down!",

      "text": "Souvla definitely has flavor, but it's honestly much too pricey for what you get. I went to Souvla for the first time with 5 friends wanting to try the \"hype\" that this place has. The atmosphere was lively, and the ambience was peaceful. It set me up for a good dinner. \n\nRegarding food, I ordered the Lamb Sandwich and got the food very quickly! The price was $14, which may seem quite reasonable. However, the thing is, the PORTION SIZE IS SMALL. I finished the sandwich quickly and found myself still hungry after dinner. The salad was $15, and the portion size was similarly much too small for the price. For a fast food-like restaurant, Souvla's prices should definitely be reduced by a few dollars. There is nothing wrong with the taste--it actually tastes very flavorful. However, it's the price that breaks it for me, and I most likely will not be returning.",

There's four choices (sour cherry, honey, baklava and olive oil with flaky salt).  We tried the baklava and olive oil with flaky salt.  Ask them to omit the salt, it was incredibly salty and tasted like I was licking a giant rock of salt.  Otherwise, the olive oil went well with it and was quite pretty to look at.  The baklava tasted like an oatmeal cookie and was the most substantial one so if you're hungry, this is the one for you.\n\nThe pita on the wrap was too chewy and hard for me.  Otherwise, there was tons of pork and veggies.  We asked for the tomatoes and pickled onions to be put on the side and we got two full cups of veggies.  The fries were excellent, very light and crispy and full of flavor but so rich and thick that after a couple of fries, I had to take the rest home.  Come here for fries and frozen yogurt but I've had better wraps.  Still, not a bad place for a cold day especially if you sit next to the chicken rotisserie machine which was really like sitting next to a cozy fire.",

After looking up several curated lists, we landed on this place. \n\nStreet parking wasn't too bad on this rainy Sunday, we just walked around the corner. We went in and placed our order with the cashier - he wasn't particularly welcoming or friendly. I guess it's to be expected with a fast casual place. We ordered the pork shoulder sandwich, juicy potatoes,  avgolemono soup, and frozen yogurt with baklava crumble. \n\nThe savory parts of our meal were pretty underwhelming. The pork shoulder was pretty tasty, but super salty, and I thought the flavors kind of clashed with the sandwich toppings. The juicy potatoes were fine, a little soft and bland. The soup was too lemony and I couldn't taste the chicken - I've had that soup elsewhere before and it wasn't so strongly lemon flavored before. The frozen yogurt was definitely the highlight.

It's a great spot if you wish to have a healthier option. Also, I liked the simplicity of the menu.\n\nI tried the Chicken Salad (over the sandwich - tough choice). Ultimately, the pictures were so convincing! I loved that the greens consisted of the dark leafy kale and lettuce, along with other vegetables + fruits. It's truly a colorful salad. The dressing is simple, made w olive oil. It had a bit too much chicken for me, which made it quite filling (I guess that's good news).\n\nI shared an order of the Greek fries. Not part of the healthy menu, but it's hard to resist and worth trying.\n\nIt's a bit pricy for lunch type foods, but the quality of the ingredients seem to justify the price. Also, it's in the city.",

      "text": "Do get the pork or lamb. Don't get the chicken. \n\nWowee I decided to stray from my normal protein anD tried the Mary's free range chicken today in a sandwich. Bad mistake. The chicken was incredibly dry and flavorless, I tried dousing it in  hot sauce but their hot sauce was bland and not spicy. I didn't want to waste a $14 sandwich so I drank a lot of water and powered through the dryness. The darker meats like lamb and pork are much more flavorful and  juicy.\n\nDo yourself another favor and order the juicy potatoes that have the drippings! Soft tender and so yuMmy. To top it off I highly suggest their frozen yogurt at $5 a pop with the elderflower honey. Yes it's pricy but it's very fragrant and not too sweet. I like the honey the best as the oTher toppings can be overly sweet. \n\nSandwiches are tasty in a pita and you can also get it in a  salad but I like the juicyness of all the ingredients together in a little pocket.",

We were almost deterred by the line at 2pm and they didn't offer online ordering, but we stuck it out and it moved pretty fast. \n\nThe gyro was pretty big, too big for one meal, but not quite enough for left overs. Pretty good flavor and of course I made a mess dripping sauce and veggies everywhere. My only complaint as that the pita wasn't as soft as I liked (felt a little dry). \nThe baklava greek yogurt was amazing. Tart with enough sweet from the honey and a bit of texture. There were other greek yogurt options on the menu and I can't wait to try those.\n\nWould definitely come back to try other items on the menu.",

When I was fortunate enough to have it, it was either from culinary students learning the ropes, or small chain restaurants like Souvla. \n\nAnd like most of those experiences, I have not been disappointed. I know it isn't authentic and I wish that we had a greater Greek interest because the culture and especially the food is amazing. The hospitality may seem cold at first BUT trust me (you've seen the, \"My Big Fat Greek\" movies right?), but hear me out, the love is there and it is especially felt the moment your tastebuds touch any one of their delicious and refreshing plates. \n\nYou don't believe me? Try it for yourself. & while you are at it, buy a meal for someone hanging outside. Let all the things you do be done in love and do good. Be kind, always.",

      "text": "The famous pics of olive oil based yogurt is what brought me here on my 48 hour trip in SF. Limited indoor and outdoor seating but I would say tables flip quickly. On a Saturday night I waited about 10 mins in line, and was able to snag a high top seat right away. \n\nNot quite used to SF sporadic weather, I was freezing after a brisk walk so soup sounded lovely. Lemons, shredded chicken, olive oil? Count me in! I ordered a soup, lamb gyro wrap and an olive oil yogurt. Food was QUICK (less than 5 mins) and no wait for ice cream if you're dining in and would like it after you're done eating the main meal. \n\n|| Lemon chicken soup (can't remember the name): 5+ stars. This was the best part of the meal, and I it's extremely underrated here. I ordered a large bowl size, and it comes with a good amount, not tiny at all. The broth itself was delicious, it's like a cross between a standard American chicken noodle mixed with lemons and rice. The lemons were not overpowering. Loved this soup, and can't wait to try and replicate at home \n\n|| Lamb pita: 4.5 stars. I debated for a while between a salad or the pita but I've heard how incredibly soft and chewy the pita was and couldn't resist. The pita itself was very fluffy and a great size. Toppings were standard but nothing too overpowering to the lamb which again was salty and fatty and everything you want in gyro. It was a tad on the salty side but otherwise  I would order this again \n\n|| Olive oil yogurt: 3 stars. I think this was a bit of a disappointment and I think it was personal preference. The yogurt itself was great - it's similar to a tart flavored yogurt you'd find at your favorite yogurt place (but better). I wasn't a fan of the olive oil and sea salt. It just didn't work for me on a yogurt, but I would say give it a try. The actual olive oil was golden yellow and of very high quality \n\nOverall, between how fast service was to ambiance and quality of food Souvla is a 5. Def recommend trying the soup, I think it's the best on the menu!",

      "text": "The long bookmarked Souvla was finally crossed off my list this weekend and I am SO satisfied. If you're in the Hayes you might as well add this as one of your stops in the area. \n\nWhile the line may seem long when you walk up to the restaurant, it does go by fairly quickly. They have two registers but they break it out by placing your order for your yogurt before you get to the main register to order your entrees. \n\nLocated in the Hayes you can opt to grab a seat inside, but they do have a communal sitting area outdoors  \n\n| WHAT WE GOT | \n\n+ Lamb Sandwich - Not your typical gyro! I loved that the lamb slices were nice chunks instead of the standard strips of meat. The lamb was tender and paired well with the feta and thinly cut slices of cucumber. The red onions were a nice flavor change to what I'm used to. \n\n+ Chicken Salad - If you're not feeling the lamb this is a great alternative to go with. The portion size is huge and enough to share. The chicken here was tender and fennel and pea shoots were tasty combos. I'm not a huge fan of fruits in my salads but it did add a nice citrus flavor to the salad. \n\n+ Frozen Greek Yogurt with Baklava Crumble & Honey Syrup - I'm typically skeptical since I'm not the biggest fan of greek yogurt, but the froyo here was not too tart which I liked. The baklava crumble was savory but I with that it was a little more toasted. Can't go wrong with their honey syrup. YUM.\n\n+ Greek Fries - A must get with your order if you don't add it to your salad. The fries are crisped to perfection and had nice flavor with the lemon/parsley without it being soggy. \n\nDid I mention that all of the above got to our table is less than 10 mins!? SUPER QUICK service. Staff here is super friendly as well.",

Despite all the hype I've heard about Souvla in the past, this was hands-down the worst meal I've had in my days on Yelp, earning the questionable honor of being the first restaurant to ever get one star from me.\n\nAnd why, you ask? Well, in search of something savory after my sweets binge across the street at Salt & Straw, I finally decided to knock Souvla off my bookmarks, opting to try their lamb pita. And instead of whatever praise that everyone's given it, I was met with dry, overcooked lamb, served in hard, dense, pita bread that I had to gnaw on in order to break off. This was so much work that I gave up towards the end, just opting to eat the filling, because even as difficult as that was, the Asian in me couldn't let (paid) food go to waste like that. At least the flavors were okay?\n\nI can't see myself ever coming here again for their food, but I might still take a chance on their frozen yogurt.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - The seating here is mixed, with a variety of high top counter seating and low top chairs, but you can definitely find accessible seats.\n\nBathroom - Didn't check them out.",

      "text": "The food here is GREAT. The review is about a staff member that doesn't have manners.\n\nToday I was trying to order pickup through DoorDash/Caviar and I kept on getting errors as I was driving to Souvla from work. I tried for about 20 min. \n\nWhen I arrived at the Hayes location, I told the person taking my order that the DoorDash/Caviar apps were not working. She relayed the message to a guy with glasses (I think it was Miguel) and he immediately waved his hand in front of the pickup orders on the shelves and said it's working fine in a dismissive tone.\n\nAll I was trying to point out was that there was an error from DoorDash/Caviar in processing orders on my phone. Instead, I got a defensive reply like I'm the one who doesn't know how to order and it's my fault for having to order in person.\n\nI work hard helping people every day at my job. Having to deal with someone who is rude for no reason is just a waste of my time and money",

My group ordered pork, lamb and veg sandwiches, juicy potatoes, greek fries, and greek olive oil and flaky sea salt frozen greek yogurt. All their sandwiches were delicious and the greek fries were well seasoned. The potatoes were small in portion and just okay, not worth it for the price. The frozen greek yogurt was unique and delightful and refreshing but definitely to be shared with at least 2 people. It was sweet, salty, and tart all at the same time. However, the staff was rude and unfriendly. Customer service can be improved.",

I took an order of their Mary's Free Range Chicken Salad to go and the smell was doing all sorts of magic to my nose I couldn't wait to dig in. It was 110% worth the wait. All these different flavors blending together: sweet oranges, tart Greek yogurt, juicy chicken, bitter greens to make a party in your mouth. For a salad, the price is definitely on the pricier side but I honestly got full after only eating half of a portion so it's a hefty amount of food. \n\nThe wait was nonexistent as the to go order came out instantly. The ambiance is great for a date with lit candles or you can take it to go and eat it with the view of the Painted Ladies in the back ( which is what I did). Can't wait to go back and try their different meats and wraps!!",

However, the convenience and speed/efficiency are major pluses, so I'm rounding up for that, the great service I received here, and their delicious Greek yogurt froyo.\n\nRecommended:\n-Frozen Greek yogurt ($5) - I've tried this with both the Cretan wildflower honey and the olive oil and sea salt toppings, and I recommend the latter if you like more adventurous flavor combinations. The honey sounded good in theory but solidified on the frozen yogurt very quickly, so eating it wasn't that enjoyable. The froyo itself is creamy, not overly sweet, and slightly tangy - I really like it.\n\nOK:\n-Greek fries ($5) - nothing too remarkable but they're good fries! Topped with olive oil, mizithra cheese, parsley, and lemon.\n-Breakfast sandwich ($13) - pita with scrambled eggs, rice, feta, avgolemono, and meat of your choice - I got this with Mary's free-range chicken. It was mostly good (and mostly rice/pita/egg) but the chicken was dry, and the pita felt very thick and dry. I would probably order a bowl instead of a sandwich on future visits since I don't think their pita quality is that great.",

The Zen Center is near Hayes Valley, so I found myself wanting to have a fun meal in Hayes Valley at the Mediterranean restaurant Souvla...\n\nSouvla has a limited menu and it's fast casual food. I decided on the pork shoulder wrap, which is like a gyro, but not exactly a gyro. The pork shoulder wrap was $12 and cheaper than the chicken wrap by $1. The pork shoulder was like a shredded carnitas. It had feta, tomato, and some cucumber. It was pretty good...I was worried I would find this spot overpriced. \n\nAnd to top this meal off, I had the baklava crumbles frozen yogurt for $5. It was pretty good. It could have had more baklava crumbles. The vanilla froyo itself was average. I didn't order a drink here.\n\nThe seating is limited and for people to have a quick bite. Souvla is popular in Hayes Valley and I believe they have other locations, but it's a treat...and an experience.",

The line gets long during lunch time, so make sure you plan accordingly.\n\nI grabbed a pork wrap and baklava Greek yogurt. \nThe pork wrap was nice and juicy. It was seasoned well, which made it pair great with the pickled onions and feta. It was a bit messy because the juice from the meat dripped, but other than that, it was solid! \n\nThe Greek yogurt was huge. I grabbed the baklava one because I'm a pretty big fan of the pastry, but I think their version was okay. It was more doughy than anything. It resembled dough and honey and was a bit underwhelming. The yogurt itself was nice, the perfect tartness and perfect consistency. I don't think I would grab this again, but I would consider getting the yogurt itself!",

Since it was a holiday weekend (and most people tend to leave town), we figured it would be the best time to take them to Souvla since you can't exactly make reservations here.\n\nWe lucked out and found a table for four outside in the parklet area. My dad and bf ordered inside and then we picked the food up when it was ready! The staff still services the parklet area by clearing dishes and cleaning tables, but since it is outside, unfortunately you cannot drink any alcoholic beverages out there.\n\nWe all ordered the Mary's chicken salad and it was delicious as usual. We also split a couple of frozen yogurts and were stuffed by the time we left our table.\n\nThanks again for another delicious meal!",

      "text": "In all honesty, does a salad ever get you excited?  Ever since I saw all the pics and heard all the hype over Souvla's chicken salad, I've been wanting to try them out. Let's face it, the cheese may not make it healthy.  But it's a big, quality salad.\n\nI was afraid of a wait when I got there even though it was before 4:30.  But I placed my order and sat down by the rotisserie spit and within several minutes was presented with my takeout orders of one chicken wrap and one pork wrap.  However when we were ready to indulge, we noticed on his pork wrap box it stated lamb.  I couldn't tell if was lamb and taste wise it didn't taste gamey like lamb can be.  This was disappointing how they likely got the order wrong.  We don't eat lamb, but I guess on the flip side it didn't taste like lamb from what I remember (it's been at least 10-15 years for me).  Wraps and salads have the same contents aside from the pita wrap, and salads tend to be $1 more. \n\nHubs and I usually go with the chicken salad anytime we go.  The salad consists of romaine (pre Romaine E. Coli breakout), spit fired Mary's chicken, pickled red onion, navel oranges, fennel, mizthira cheese, pea shoots and \"granch\" dressing.  I'm guessing granch is a Greek ranch dressing.  It's a loaded and filling salad.  The chicken was moist and plentiful.  Loved the light citrus from the orange, the tang from the pickled onions.  The cheese was perfectly balanced (sometimes feta can be a bit strong).  Oh and I had some of their fries too our first time which were perfectly crisp and seasoned with the same cheese, olive oil, lemon juice and parsley.\n\nIf I find myself dining in instead of taking out, I would love to sample one of their Greek yogurts.  It's a Hayes Valley gem for somewhat healthy, quick and pleasing food.",

      "text": "I have a few friends who rave about Souvla. Since my first experience was pretty much just okay, I decided to give them another shot. The main part of my weekly office lunch arrived on Friday, November 9th around 12:15pm.\n\nI got the Lamb Sandwich: Spit-roasted Superior Farms leg of lamb with harissa-spiked yogurt, cucumber, radish, pickled red onion, and feta cheese wrapped in warm and fluffy pita bread, Yogurt on the Side ($14), add Side of Souvla Hot Sauce (+$0.50). The meat inside was pretty good. Had a nice smokiness to it. I liked the mixture of veggies, but I didn't care for the yogurt. I thought it was too thick to meld the whole sandwich into a cohesive bite. The hot sauce also wasn't very spicy. I ended up just using one of the hot sauces I had at my desk. I'd suggest saving the 50 cents and using another hot sauce if you really want some heat.\n\nMaybe Souvla just isn't my cup of tea. Giving them 3 stars as I did enjoy the meat and veggies.",

The fries are such a perfect thickness and crispiness and not overly garlic-y. The chicken wrap is filling and delicious and the orange in it is so refreshing and complements the overall flavors.\n+ even though it's popular, they are efficient and they take orders quickly and food doesn't take too long to come out either!\n+ the Greek yogurt!!! Highly recommend trying if you come - I got the one with baklava toppings which was pretty good, not overly sweet since the tartness of the yogurt balances out the sweet pastry toppings \n+ gorgeous outdoor seating (love the outdoor lights)\n\n- the chicken in the wrap is a little dry/wish there was more white sauce but it's still pretty good\n- not cheap but it's sf so what do u expect \n- wish they had better veggie options/falafel since I don't love sweet potato\n\nLooking forward to my next visit when I'll likely try their rosè and the salad (salad looks pretty big so you'll probably have leftovers unless you eat a lot or come super hungry).",

      "text": "I was looking for small and something quick to eat while in the Mission. I honestly never order a salad as a main dish and I personally think it's not really worth it (in my opinion). Walking into this place I saw a very nice and minimal interior. That's one of my favorite things about SF cause a lot of places have very tasteful decor. Aside from that i saw chicken being grilled and was instantly hungry. I have been told they are known for their big bowl of delicious Greek fries but I didn't want anything too heavy so for on a rare occasion I ordered a salad to split and I was pretty skeptical (because I never order a salad at a restaurant). \n\n[ SALAD AS A MAIN DISH IS NOT WORTH IT, CHANGE MY MIND]\n\nLet alone, I ordered the free range chicken salad and once it came out I was pretty excited to try it. The first thing that caught my eye were tangerines, again I never was a fan having fruit in a salad like berries and etc. But I can say that my ignorance was making me miss out about how well this paired with the salad. From the dressing, the pea shoots and the chicken, it was the best salad I've had. I feel like I'm only saying that cause, you know... but I'll be honest, this definitely changed my perception about seeing if salads are worth it when ordering as a main dish. Since I got a full bowl split in half I can say that I left satisfied and light. I will honestly look forward coming back here and order a Greek fries as well. \n\nI no longer think salads are a waste of money.",

      "text": "Visited the Hayes Valley Souvla on a Sunday morning. My friend and I arrived about 10 minutes before they opened at noon and were third in line. The line gets longer as the day goes on, so getting there early was a plus!\n\nI ordered a Lamb Gyro and enjoyed it. The pita was warm and had plenty of olive oil, and the tzatziki and feta were zippy and lovely. The lamb chunks were large and a bit fatty. This gyro is truly for the lamb lovers out there and is heavy on the lamb.\n\nThe true star of the meal was the Baklava Greek Frozen Yogurt. My friend encouraged me to try it and wow!! The Greek yogurt has wonderful tangy notes that were very refreshing. The sweetness of the baklava paired with the tangy yogurt perfectly. The baklava had an amazing texture as well. All around a super star dessert and something I'll be back to have again and again!!\n\nWe sat at a one of the tables that now spill out into the street. Hayes street is closed to cars right now, and there are several tables in the street to sit at and enjoy your meal.",

      "text": "Not your traditional Greek restaurant, everything has a bit of flair, ex. Oranges in your chicken sandwich, pea shoots etc. this is visually appealing, however, it doesn't seem to be a cohesive flavor that works as anything other than a fancying up of traditional dishes. \n\nFood:\nChicken Sandwich: dry and flavorless, could've used a sauce, wouldn't get again. Also the oranges don't work with the chicken because it's so dry and the orange is juicy, the different textures are a bit shocking. \n\nVeg Salad: decent, ordered because it's their only veg option, sweet potato was cooked wonderfully, however, I echo the sentiment of a different user that said it's a little acidic and has a fair amount of cheese which they rely on for a lot of the flavor. \n\nBaklava Crumble and Honey Greek Yogurt: the saving grace of this meal. The tart Greek frozen yogurt pairs nicely with the honey, a bit too much sweetness in the crumbles for my taste but otherwise an exceptional dessert option. (The reason for 2 stars vs 1).\n\nJuicy Potatoes: this was the dish I was most excited about and the most disappointed in. The potatoes are so bland it is just a carton of boiled potatoes cut in half and light sautéed in almost an entire stick of butter that drips off of the potatoes when you eat them. No salt, no pepper, I took them home and seasoned them, leaving most of the butter behind, and threw them in a breakfast burrito.\n\nGreek Iced Tea: this doesn't pair well with the flavors of their food, it's much too honey flavored and the bits of tea leaves in the drink come into your mouth with every sip which makes it pretty dominating with a meal, and it's not tasty enough for me to order on its own. Sadly threw most of mine away. \n\nThey are following safety guidelines, service is fast, and the entire surrounding area of Hayes Valley is a cute place to walk and shop/ browse safely. Parking was difficult to find but it's SF.",

Their fries are flavorful and the right amount of crispy with a little soft was on the inside. One order is definitely enough for two people to share. \n\nYou can also get the food as salads.

The only drawback is that it is very hard to find parking so I would recommend walking or taking an Uber.  I brought my friend here for dinner and we ordered the exact same thing.  We got the chicken sandwich, cheery soda and frozen greek yogurt.  The chicken was juicy and it was literally dripping with flavor!  The chicken was so moist and tender!  The pita bread was warm and topped with chicken, lettuce, cheese, red onions and mandarin oranges. The flavor was refreshing and savory!  The cheery soda was ok the small side, but barely enough. I really liked the frozen greek yogurt!  It was not overly sweet, it was creamy and sour, but not overpowering.  I will definitely return to this place!   Overall the meal was delicious and satisfying!  I highly recommend this place and if you are in SF come check it out!",

Absolutely delicious. I had something similar in Los Angeles, but Souvla was the real deal. I am featuring the Baklava Crumbles and Honey Syrup. \n\nParking looked non-existent. I took an Uber to the area. There's a nice, small park nearby where you can enjoy your yogurt.",

      "text": "Super cute and trendy spot in Hayes Valley next to the park! Seating is limited so we ordered to-go. They gave us a number to wait outside and the food came out relatively quickly.\n\nI got the chicken salad with Greek fries, and the often-recommended baklava honey frozen yogurt. I really enjoyed the fresh creaminess of the yogurt, although it was more tart than I expected. The honey baklava topping was absolutely perfect and my favorite part of the whole meal :)\n\nThe chicken was flavorful and tender and I really enjoyed the orange slices in the salad. The greens were fresh and crispy but the dressing was a little too oily for me. I loved the shredded mizithra cheese on both the fries and salad. Next time I'll try to eat in-store because I think takeout made the fries soggy! \n\nOverall a great spot for takeout or eating in, with fresh high-quality ingredients. Would definitely come back!",

All the counter seats, stools by the wall and the small cramped space by the window was quickly taken by others who haven't even ordered yet. There's no waiting area so a bunch of us who did to go orders kinda just stood in the middle of the dining room waiting for our food while servers and other diners passed by on the way to the kitchen and bathroom. \n\nI got my order after 15 minutes and my fries were not even piping hot. That's disappointing! As I was leaving, I saw a homeless guy swipe a bunch of napkins from the diners who were sitting outside. \n\nTerribly crowded, in the middle of a super busy pedestrian sidewalk and homeless people just within an arm's length of your $15 lamb salad.

The wrap consist of pulled roasted chicken with pea shoots, pickle red onions, navel oranges, mizithra cheese, and a homemade dressing.\n\nWe also ordered a side of Greek fries with parsley and mizithra cheese. The fries was also good. \n\nSouvla also serves a frozen Greek yogurt with different selection of toppings. I recommend the Baklava and honey syrup.

However, turnover doesn't seem to be an issue.\nCan choose between chicken, lamb, pork, or vegetable as a pita sandwich or salad. Both are solid options. My favorite is probably the pork as it is very succulent.

      "text": "I love Greek food and I've been wanting to try Souvla for awhile now. Having dined at Novy in Noe Valley just yesterday, I am clearly on a roll. \n\nIt's a very casual place, almost like fast food except the quality is so much better. It was a gorgeous day and we were able to snag a great table outside. \n\nWe had the chicken gyro, the lamb gyro and those oh so necessary garlic fries. \n\nLamb Gyro\nHarissa spikes yogurt sauce, cucumber, radish, pickled red onion and feta cheese. \n\nThe lamb was tender, the flavors had depth and the fresh veggies added a nice crunch. I didn't find there to be a lot of yogurt sauce and did not at all get the hot of harissa at all. My biggest disappointment is that this was barely warm despite the fact that we picked it up as soon as it was ready. \n\nSame story with our garlic fries :(. And no one, I mean no one likes barely warm French fries. We were there at right around 130, so there's no reason we needed to wait for food that wasn't even barely warm...\n\nChicken Gyro\nMary's free range chicken, \"Granch\" dressing, fennel, navel orange, pickled red onion, pea shoots and mizithra cheese. \n\nThe chicken was kind of shredded, moist and very flavorful. I didn't love the orange but I did love all the other veggies; those pea shoots were a great addition. Again, it was barely warm so that was a disappointment. But the flavors were all there and it's worth ordering. \n\nWe had some sauce to sip the fries in (there's a few choices) and we took the one they recommended which I think was the \"Granch\". I give it a meh. Fries were actually better without it. \n\nWe also ordered an iced tea and it actually came in a bottle and is imported from Greece. Flavor was really nice and subtle. But at $4 bottle a bit pricey when you're used to endless iced tea. \n\nAll in all a good lunch despite the lack of warmth for the food. I'd go back again but make sure everything came out hot.",

My friend and I got a number card for our order and we were lucky to find a table right away. Since they gave me a number stand for my order, I thought the food will be served to our table but instead, I have to pick them up at the window counter. It was a little chaotic there because there were a mix of people who are lining up to order and waiting for their food. \n\nWe got the pork salad, the Greek fries and the Greek frozen yogurt with baklava crumbles.\n\nPork shoulder salad $13 (3/5)\nThe salad tasted very fresh with the pickled onions. The pork was well seasoned but on the dry side. There was way too much feta on the salad for my preference. Comparing to other places that serve salad in SF, this is only mediocre for the price. \n\nGreek fries $5 (3.7/5)\nThere are a lot of negative comments on the fries but surprisingly this tasted much better than I anticipated. They were crispy at the end parts with the potato skin and soft and fluffy in the middle. Personally I prefer my fries to be more crispy but they were delicious with the cheese. It will be better if they came out hotter.\n\nGreek yogurt with baklava crumbles $5 (4/5)\nI would give this 5/5 if I don't count the baklava crumble. The frozen yogurt tasted on point with the perfect balance of sour and sweetness. A good baklava would have a crispy texture from the fillo dough and crunchy texture from the chopped nuts if baked perfectly but the ones here are all mushed together into chucks and tasted a little bit stale. I highly recommend trying the yogurt since that was the highlight of our meal but definitely not with the baklava crumble. \n\nI will come back for the yogurt if I am in the area but probably not for the other food on the menu.",

You order at the front, get a number and seat yourself. I asked if I should order the Greek yogurt now or later and they told me now, I could always hand the cashier the receipt after our meal to get our Greek Yogurt. \n\nI ordered:\n\nChicken Sandwich (Mary's Free Ranch Chicken, \"Granch\" dressing, Fennel, Navel Orange, Pickled Red Onion, Pea Shoots, Mizithra Cheese: I really enjoyed my sandwich, there was a lot of shredded chicken and I loved the texture and flavors of the pickled red onion and navel orange with the chicken. I wish there was a little bit more Granch dressing - I should have poured some of the Granch dip I got with my fries in the sandwich.\n\nGreek Fries with \"Granch\" Greek Yogurt: Fries were crispy and went well with the Granch dressing.\n\nGreek yogurt with Baklava crumbles and honey sryup: WOW. I loved this. This is by far my favorite, the tangy yogurt and honey syrup went really well together. And the Baklava crumbles made this dessert even more delicious. \n\nA great place for a casual meal and good food. Highly recommended!",

      "text": "Variety of vegetarian options on the menu: 3/5\n\nSo I totally get that the fine print under the Souvla brand is \"Spit-Fired Meats.\" As in that is a part of the restaurant name. That being said, their Vegetarian entree is one of the most amazing combination of flavors and food items I've ever had. I wish I discovered this joint sooner, but randomly my friends told me about it after they had been ordering this vegetarian item for months. So rude; I wish they told me earlier.\n\nI've only ever gotten the salad version, but I'm sure the sandwich is just as good (not sure what bread they use though). The roasted white sweet potato adds a great texture, and the garlic yogurt sauce complements it with its cooler temperature. I also really enjoyed the Mizhithra cheese; super unique and authentic. Been making my own pickled onion since I had that salad as well!\n\nOk and THEN the dessert! Oh wow that greek yogurt just came out of left field and knocked my socks off. It is so fresh and the tartness is just perfect that it feels like you're having a healthy snack. I went for the sea salt and olive oil which was pretty bold, although I've been told the sour cherry syrup or wildflower honey is better. Anyway get to this place asap!",

      "text": "if there was a Souvla close to where I go to school I would literally eat there every day until my loans tell me otherwise. I have not had a pita wrap with such a unique, fresh, flavorful chicken filling in it EVER. The citrus pairing with the oils and the chicken is a genius combo so props to the sous chef! The meat is SO moist. It's hard to do a chicken pita wrap well unless you douse it with some creamy sauce. There was a slight drizzle of a yogurt based sauce on the wrap but the natural flavors of all the ingredients in the wrap shone through. The side salad is simple and fresh and great if you're looking for a healthier option but honestly the wrap is a 10/10 health wise if you're not training to be a bikini model. \n\nThe place is worth the lunch line and the hype! Interior is super cute too--white and beach blue themed, just like Santorini. They even serve coffee in Greek cups. Authenticity with a modern twist, just to be adored. I would love to return to try the other menu items!!!",

From long lines, ever-increasing prices to ever-decreasing portions, and charging for everything from napkins, utensils to ketchup, what once was a \"must-have\" in San Francisco now is rather forgettable. \n\nBoth lamb and pork, while tasty, are uncomfortably oily, even when eaten in salad form. Their chicken remains a healthier choice although suffers from dryness. If you've had Souvla before, chances are you'll try it, and even like it, many more times.

      "text": "Just thinking about what I'm gonna write is making me want to eat here again. Right now. Plus it's lunch break so this would be PERFECT. And it's also pretty hot over here so some Greek frozen yogurt would be the most perfect ending to my imaginary encore Souvla lunch. \n\nWe came here for a late lunch and I am glad it was a little late because I'm sure at a prime hour, this place is hard to get a seat. Super cute space with seating outside and inside. The outside tables were already occupied but the inside was so cute so I was glad to sit on the tall tables with the high stools inside the restaurant. \n\nWhen we walked in, we were greeted by the owner and right away, my son spocks out the frozen greek yogurt machine. The owner was so nice, he gave my little monster a small sample which of course, being the ice cream-yogurt-soft serve-anything frozen dairy-monster that I am, I had to take a lick of that. I almost wanted to just order and eat that before actual lunch!\n\nLuckily the menu is not very large which is good for me because I am probably the most indecisive person everrrrr. We decided on the chicken and the lamb dishes which were both delicious. I am not a lamb eater but this was hands down the best lamb dish I have ever eaten. The lamb was tender and soft and very tasty. It was served with harissa-spiked yogurt, cucumbers, radish, red onions, and feta cheese. The chicken was also good with a different type of dressing, fennel, orange, red onion, pea shoots, and a mizithra cheese. Different flavors but both DELICIOUS. Both were wrapped in delicious pita. We also ordered the greek fries which were yummy and tasty. \n\nOf course you know we HAD to get some of the REAL GREEK frozen yogurt for dessert. We had it with the baklava crumbles and ohhhhhh, you have to get this if you like baklava like I do. Don't get me wrong, this frozen yogurt tastes wonderful by itself. It was tart which is hands down my favorite yogurt flavor. Plus, it was REAL GREEK frozen yogurt so how can you go wrong?\n\nIf you love Greek food like I do, or just love frozen yogurt like I do, give this place a try if you're in the area!",

      "text": "this place is one of my go-tos when i'm in the city! this place is enforcing social distancing by closing their dining areas and when you order there are separate windows for ordering and pickup with a plexiglass separating you from the employees. if there's people waiting for their orders, they have 6ft distance stickers on where to stand. \n\nif you've never been here, my all time favorite is definitely their frozen greek yogurt with baklava crumbles and honey syrup!! i shared this with my boyfriend but i definitely wish I got my own. I also really like their avgolemono soup, if you really like a lemony creamy coup then this is the soup for you!! its definitely very filling since there's rice and chicken in it too. their salads are also pretty good and a decent size which I didn't expect but i would also definitely try the sandwiches which are basically like a street pita with your choice of meat and their toppings listed on the menu. usually i would only come here for dessert but their sandwiches are pretty good. pro tip, if you want an extra level of flavor on the dessert, get the greek olive oil & sea salt frozen yogurt and add baklava crumbles its so good i highly recommend!",

Most of the Souvla locations are pretty small, so be prepared to wait a bit to get seats; or you could just come earlier too. \n\nThe pork wrap was really nice and juicy - the sauce that came with it was delicious and pair very well with the pork. The pita bread was also soft and fluffy! My friend and I also go the chicken wrap, which was a bit of a disappointment because the chicken was quite dry, and the wrap didn't actually come with any sauce. The mandarin oranges were a nice touch tho.\n\nGreek fries were good, even though we didn't get a dipping sauce. The frozen greek yogurt with baklava and honey was bomb - and the perfect amount of sweetness - you MUST save stomach space for the frozen yogurt!!",

I always get their pork salad. My s/o got the lamb wrap once and mentioned that it was a bit dry, so either ask for more sauce or just get a bowl of meat with veg! \n\nTheir fries are also a must order. They're always fresh and hot. No dipping sauce needed, although you can ask for ketchup. I've seen some customers order fries on top of their salads and inside of their wraps, as well! If you're not a big eater, you'd easily be able to split the salad along with some fries. \n\nAs for drinks, their white wine is delish. There's also self serve water near the register.\n\nI've never tried their yogurt, but the flavors all look heavenly. One day, I'll have to pass up Salt & Straw and try the greek yogurt at Souvla instead!",

      "text": "Great combination of flavors, ingredients, and colors. I got the chicken salad which was full of flavor and texture. Their kale was so soft and the chicken was juicy and tender. I never like having fruits in my salad though so I had to pick out the oranges (which were really good on its own). Besides that and the slightly too salty sauce, I enjoyed eating my salad very much. It was super filling, large, and not terribly priced ~$13-15. \n\nThe space, however, was tiny. On a warmer day, I would have opted to eat out in the park or at their standing tables outside but not when it's 40 degrees outside. Expectedly, the place was very crowded when I went and we had to pounce on the first available space after ordering. If you order a yogurt, you can pick it up later as long as you keep your receipt. (They are a pay and take a number type place). \n\nI also got the baklava greek yogurt ($5) and it was delicious. Unsure why the baklava was so jam-like; it felt mostly like hardened honey and was pretty sweet. The yogurt itself was smooth, sweet, and slightly sour which paired well with the drizzled honey (not as much with the baklava which was slightly overpowering). I tried the olive oil/sea salt one and it was pretty unique as well.\n\nOverall a solid place that I would frequent more if I lived nearby.",

After that we were having a casual conversation and not even 3 minutes went by when I was greeted to my lamb wrap. Souvla is very quick and does NOT mess around. \n\nThere's outside seating and a self-service station for water. The restroom is clean, the restaurant's atmosphere is welcoming, and the music selection is excellent. \n\nI will be coming back for brunch next time I'm in San Francisco. I will be coming back for the delectable lamp wrap, amiable staff, especially Alejandra, who was attentive, sweet, and always had a smile on her face.",

Don't get me wrong, the food is good. It's fresh, made with care and pretty tasty, but it wasn't as over the top as I was expecting.\n\nThe side salad was nice, fresh, very healthy and well dressed. Roasted potatoes in chicken fat were luxurious and well cooked. The lamb souvlaki pita was just ok. Not much flavor, but it was fresh. Wished it was also a bit bigger with more meat. It's a great space, fits the fast casual moniker, but I wouldn't line up for 30 minutes to eat here like the lines sometimes are on the weekends.",

      "text": "Souvla is one of my favorite spots in SF. It's trendy, tasty, and just sooo good. I love Mediterranean food, and this place is the perfect combination of quality food with fast, to-go food. \n\nWe found street parking nearby pretty easily. The restaurant was crowded, with a few spots open to eat. It is first come, first served on seating. So we had to squeeze into two seats for three of us. At souvla, you can pick between a salad or pita with your choice of meat: lamb, chicken, pork (?) and maybe another type. I've tried the lamb pita before, so I decided to get the lamb salad this time. \n\nAlthough it costs $15 for a salad, the serving is huge and they are generous with the lamb chunks inside. The base was a mix of kale and romaine lettuce. And the salad was topped with feta cheese, lamb, onions, and dressing. It was so good! The salads or pita are equally as good. The meat is seasoned well and they give a generous serving with any type of dish. \n\nFor dessert, you have to try the greek yogurt soft serve. The baklava one is my favorite, but I have heard nothing but great things about all the other flavors. It's probably best to share after a meal since its quite big, but I got one all for myself since I wouldn't be back in a while!",

Overall, sad to say but the prices are in line with what you'd expect to pay right now in SF even for a quick, casual meal - with tax and tip, the lamb, yogurt and ice tea was about $30.  I would recommend this place if you have an itch for some lamb gyro.",

      "text": "Souvla is a SF staple and while their frozen greek yogurt is to die for, I can't say the same for their entrees. I ordered the chicken salad and lamb sandwich while I was there. At $15 a dish, it's a pretty steep price point for what you're getting. The salad was colorful and tasty, including various sprouts and fruits like orange slices. However, the chicken was slightly dry. The sandwich wasn't my favorite since the lamb was exceptionally game-y which is not up my alley. So overall, the savory dishes left a lot to be desired. On the other hand, their frozen greek yogurt made with Straus milk was delicious! I tried both the baklava crumbles with honey syrup and the olive oil with sea salt and was very impressed! The frozen yogurt was perfectly tart and so incredibly smooth. The baklava crumbles kind of tasted like sweet oatmeal and had the texture of day old granola. The olive oil flavor was very unique, but a tad salty!",

      "text": "Souvla reminds me of the Mediterranean goodness of Zankou Chicken in LA except in a fast casual dining experience that is quintessentially the Bay.\n\nNot knowing much about Souvla, I came to Souvla with no expectations.  As a fan of Zankou Chicken in LA, I never thought I could find something similar up here in the Bay.  However, consider myself a convert!  For all their meats, they have the option of making it into a sandwich or salad.  Considering the price, I was a little worried, but the size of the portions for both the salad ($13-15) and sandwich ($12-14) are pretty big.  \n\nPlus, this is not your typical standard Mediterranean fare.  They combine their meats with nice mix of brightly colored veggies and cheese to make for an overall satisfying bite.  I thoroughly enjoyed my chicken, but I was not really impressed with the lamb.  However, they were good and solid bites that left me wanting to come back.\n\nWhat really made me fall for this place was their frozen Greek yogurt.  As a big fan of froyo, I had high expectations for it.  The yogurt not only met my expectations but exceeded them!  It has the slight sour taste one expects from Greek yogurt and also not super sweet.  However, paired with Baklava crumble, which brings a nice crunchy sweetness, one bite from it was just amazing!\n\nWhile the lines were pretty long, the line does seem to move pretty fast.  If you are wanting to sit down in the restaurant, there is limited seating.  However, with the nearby park, you could easily order to go and walk on over.\n\nOverall, Souvla does Mediterranean food with a nice modern twist that is worth trying out if you are in the SF area!",

      "text": "Absolutely the best place for fresh, fast, and delicious food in the area.  I honestly have to stop myself from grabbing something whenever I walk by, it's that good.\n\nFirstly, you must try the frozen Greek yogurt with olive oil and flaky sea salt.  The yogurt is thick and creamy, but doesn't leave you feeling heavy, as it's yogurt.  It's got a slight tang to it, but not as much as traditional frozen yogurt.  The olive oil and salt beautifully complement the frozen yogurt, and it's a fresh, delightful combination.  What I also appreciate is that they give you enough olive oil and sea salt so that every bite has a bit of each.  I've never tried any of their other flavors of frozen yogurt, but honestly I don't need to as this one is so good.\n\nThe rest of the menu is also delicious!  I always get either the chicken or pork salad.  They're really fresh, wonderfully flavored, and will leave you feeling very satiated because they're full of so many good mix-ins.  If you've got a bigger party, you can also order one of their full rotisserie chickens, which you see roasting at the back of the restaurant and are really juicy.\n\nEven though there's usually a line outside, it goes quickly.  I've never waited more than ~10 minutes to order, and the food usually comes out just as fast.  I've always gotten food to go, so I'm not sure how difficult it is to find seating, as the place isn't too large.  But there's a big plaza right down the block, so you shouldn't have too much of an issue finding a place nearby.  Definitely come to Souvla if you're in the area.  The food is so delicious and fresh and everything's reasonably priced.  Make sure to get the frozen Greek yogurt with olive oil and sea salt!",

      "text": "Souvla, Souvla oh how I love you! It's been almost two years since I've been back to San Francisco so naturally my move was to Uber directly to Souvla for lunch. Please come up with a better choice!\n\nIt was a gorgeous afternoon and the outdoor sidewalk seating was full, but the big windows at the storefront were open and there was plenty of inside seating (I was pleasantly surprised for 1pm). They have a choice of three spit-roasted meats and one vegetarian option and you can get it in either a sandwich or salad form. I love the simplicity of this- easy ordering and any option is delicious. They also have a large selection of sides, but unless you're sharing it tends to be a lot of food!\n\nI ordered the lamb salad, no sides, and decided to treat myself with an $11 glass of Greek rosé. (My plan was to treat myself with their froyo too, but more on that below). I was a little hesitant to go for the wine but was super happy that I did because you get a lot of bang for your buck! The guy at the counter filled my glass with a small/average/not generous pour and gave me this little tin pitcher that was filled with the rest of the wine (see picture). And wow, it was a lot of wine. Not sure in ounces, but I got 2.5 decent sized glasses out of the total wine serving! Definitely a great deal in my book!\n\nI had been craving their frozen Greek yogurt with baklava crumbles for soo long and my plan was to get it, but I was so full from the salad (couldn't finish it and I'm a serious eater). Their frozen Greek yogurt is so good and they have four options of toppings- I can vouch for the baklava crumbles and cherry syrup but the baklava is truly what dreams are made of. \n\nNew life goal is to always live within walking distance to a Souvla location!",

      "text": "Souvla is one of my favorite places to grab food in the whole city! I used to live on the same block as the Souvla in Hayes Valley, and went there their opening week. I've been obsessed with Souvla since! I used to get it about 3x a week after work for a healthy and quick meal. I moved to Duboce Triangle and my first thought was how sad I was that I could no longer go to Souvla, and only weeks after I moved, they opened this location on Divisidero. I resumed eating Souvla about once a week while I lived there :) \n\nTheir Avgolemono soup is outstanding as is their pork and lamb salads and \"sandwiches\". I like how they have non-sweet options for their yogurts; my favorite is the olive oil and sea salt. When it isn't shelter-in-place time, they also have amazing breakfast options. I also love their Greek sodas, especially the sour cherry one! Sometimes I drop by just to stock up on sodas. Their Divisidero location has a really nice back patio you can eat in, complete with two levels and shrubbery. Both Hayes Valley and Divis also have some eating areas in the front as well, if you want to watch the street traffic. \n\nI live farther now and I occasionally order them for delivery. I've never had a problem with my order; never a missing or botched up item. \n\nI hope Souvla lives on forever. I don't have any bad things to say. They're just the best! I'm a Super Souvla Supporter! :)",

YAY! protein and a dessert all in one.\nCONS:\n- melts really quick in the sun so don't go sit in that Hayes Valley square unless you eat fast.\n\nI'd totally come and eat here again.  This was on the recommendation of a friend when I was just swinging through and I definitely appreciate the note!  Parking in Hayes Valley (like all of SF) is a chore so use public transportation.  It's a quick 12min walk from Civic Center BART stop and for all the Californians out there, the weather is way too nice almost all the time as claimed to not walk haha.",

It gets crowded in the early evening so I prefer to come here for lunch or a late dinner (8ish pm). There is quite a bit of seating, but it gets a little hot in the back of the restaurant because of their rotisserie station (conversely, it's a perfect place to sit for when it's chilly outside). You have to watch out for the seats to open!\n\nYou pick either a wrap or a salad and a choice of protein (chicken, lamb, pork, or veggie). I like their salads and usually order either lamb or veggie. I've tried the pork one once, and it was also delicious! You can also get the fries on top if you're willing to indulge a little :) \n\nThe house wine is pretty tasty (I usually get the rose), and you can even buy a bottle to go.\n\nBut the crown jewel of Souvla is, of course, the Greek yogurt! I'm still debating whether I prefer the baklava or the olive oil one, but they are both amazing. It's your regular frozen yogurt taken to a whole different level.",

They have a few sides like fries and a Greek frozen yogurt. \n\nI normally get the pita wrap, but this time I got the salad. It was nicely dressed and came with a good portion of meat. For $15 it was a decent deal. The meats are slow cooked but could be more tender. You won't find your typical ground spit gyro meat here. \n\nThey get busy at night and on the weekend, so be prepared to take it to go. Large groups or families are not advised.",

      "text": "Finally made it out to one of the locations after hearing so many good things. Came here on a Sunday night with 3 friends at about 8:30pm and it was still poppin'! We were able to snag a table as people were leaving. The food came out fast (~10 minutes) despite there being so many people. \n\nI ordered the veggie salad bowl ($13) that came with sweet potato. In retrospect, I probably should have gotten a meat on it because it felt like it was missing something, but the sweet potato chunks were huge and super tasty. However, the olives on the salad were waaay too salty and overpowered the rest of it. I also wished they added more veggies or filling into the salad such as tomatoes and cucumber. \n\nMy friends all got wraps- one chicken, one pork, one lamb ($12 each). They all agreed that their meat was a bit dry, especially the lamb, but the sauce (yogurt based) helped to moisten it up. They said the pita was soft and the flavor of the sauce was not overwhelming. They put mandarin oranges in the chicken one, which was a great combo (maybe I'll try that one next time!).\n\nWe OF COURSE had to get the fro-yo after our meal. We got the baklava + honey, cretan wild flower honey, and by suggestion of the server- Greek Olive Oil + Sea Salt ($5 each). The baklava one was by far the best, the perfect amount of sweet paired with the sharp tangy-ness of the greek yogurt was perfect. I couldn't taste/see the honey syrup, but I didn't mind because the baklava was already sweet enough. I could honestly just eat the greek yogurt plain! The honey one was also good, but the Olive Oil and Sea Salt was the least favorite. Not sure how to explain it, but it tastes exactly how it sounds. There was just so much oil at the bottom of the cup and the overwhelming salt did not pair well with the greek yogurt for us. Love love love the greek yogurt, but would not recommend the olive oil +sea salt mix. \n\nI will definitely be back again!",

Once I ordered I waited to the right of the restaurant for pickup. Line was to the left, if you're looking at the restaurant. They have standing tables available on the street.

      "text": "I've tried to stroll past Souvla countless times only to encounter hordes of people overflowing onto the sidewalk. This makes for lots of weaving and dodging among folks who are either oblivious to the congestion that they're causing, or, worse yet, feel entitled to block the flow of pedestrian traffic. \n\nSo I decided to see what the buzz was about with a friend while he was in town. If anything, he's even more of a well-traveled foodie than I am, as he lives in Europe and has spent significant time in Greece, among other places. So he knows a thing or two about what constitutes good, authentic Greek fare. \n\nWe were both underwhelmed by what we got - a lamb salad for me, a wrap for him. It was all somewhat decent in a Greek Chipotle sort of way, but not knock-your-socks-off incredible. If anything, the lamb in my salad was rather rubbery and flavorless, and the whole thing was just a slog to get through when, normally, I'd be chowing down greedily if I was really enjoying it.\n\nIf there were any good points, the guy ringing orders up was friendly, and we got our orders very quickly after paying for our orders and picking up numbers to display at our table. But is it really worth the long wait? We both said no. Even if you really dig this place, you can order online so as to save yourself the time in line. \n\nI hate to be a hater, but I'd have to say that there are so many other worthy places to eat in bustling Hayes Valley. If you're doubting my observations, check out Ed U.'s always-authoritative review which generally corroborates mine.",

They give a lot of lamb chunks, I will give them that (protein quantity 5/5) which kind of justifies the price (if you can even justify a $15/16 salad). But overall, it is just bland in my opinion. The lamb is a little salty and it is not super flavorful for a salad. I wouldnt order again but I heard the juicy potatoes are really good? My friends seem to really love this spot though, so once again, all based on preference (I like a flavorful salad with lots of additions if I am going to pay for leaves LOL)",

Listen, I've been here a handful of times. I know this is a personal problem, but seriously, they're catering to an eclectic SF crowd. It's Mediterranean food and they don't have a single seafood item on their menu?! Not even fish?! \n\nIf I wanted to be a full on vegetarian, I would. But I'm not. I eat seafood. So I really, really wish they had some sort of a fish dish here. It's my only ask. I've had the veggie bowl and the veggie wrap and I'm not a huge fan. \n\nBUTTTT I have had their baklava Greek yogurt dessert. Omgggg. Heart. It. Seriously, it's that good. I only come here now for the desserts now. I'm still on strike over their non-seafood friendly menu. Other than that, lines get crazy. It's always packed. But somehow the line always moves pretty quick and there's always miraculously a spot to sit, even when you thought there'd be no chance. 4 stars!",

I had the Veg Sandwich and the Greek Fries - both unfortunately very lackluster. The veg sandwich had a great sauce, although there wasn't enough of it and it ended up being quite dry. The walnuts to top off the sandwich were a great touch. But I wish I had falafel - the potato as the 'base' was dry, too heavy almost, and very plain and bland. The fries were too thick cut, and just didn't have enough on them. There was BARELY any cheese, and it would have been great with a few additions: feta cheese, kalamata olives, and some fresh cut garlic. There's a ton to improve on. Nonetheless, I know I'll be back to try their desserts, which I've heard so much about! But I'll pass on the food until the menu has more options!",

Then the host will give you a ticket to claim your ice cream when you're ready. \n\nThe salad was big and plentiful and you can add fries on top. Talk about a dream come true?! I was unable to finish my salad and ended up taking some of it home. I was quite surprised that it had so much kale. Generally I would never order a salad with kale because it's really bitter, but this one was actually pretty good. There's also a ton of shredded chicken in the salad, yay for protein! \n\nIf you're adventurous, go with the frozen Greek yogurt with salt and olive oil but don't bite into it because all you'll get is salt. That was my biggest mistake and ended up not liking it. I enjoyed the baklava one because it's much sweeter and easy to eat.",

It's pretty fast in terms of service, not too pricey, taste great, and it's convenient!\n\nI recommend the chicken salad, it's freaking delicious, especially for chicken salad. Get the cheese on the side (I think they put too much).\n\nThe portions are pretty big, I'd take some home unless you're feeling hungry. Or save room so you can get their fries with garlic sauce add on! It's soooo good... \n\nYou can one-up your meal at the end with a Greek yogurt dessert. Not many people know this but you can choose not just one, but TWO toppings, just tell them you want half-half. I usually do baklava and cherry. But a half-sea salt topping sounds pretty enticing now that I think about it.\n\nOverall, I'd say that you should plan on sharing the fries and dessert with 2-3 people with an entree each.\n\nThe one major gripe I have is that they do not massage their salad, it's pretty damn raw, and there's been a few times where it's to raw for a nice salad.\n\nIf they change that up, it's an easy 5/5.\n\nProTip: If there's a long line, just order through their website, this has been much faster than waiting in line for me. You can specify that you want the food in regular dine-in plates and they text you when you're order is ready so you can snag a table earlier than if you waited in line to order.

It is consistently busy, and for good reason. \n\nThings that I love: You order at the counter and they bring your food out to the table. It comes super quick, too! The menu online shows calories - everything is healthy AND delicious. The menu might be limited, but they serve wine, beer, french fries, frozen yogurt... what more could you want? There is nice outdoor seating. The list goes on! \n\nAs far as the food goes, order the salads! I could seriously eat the pork salad for every meal. It's really delicious and a perfect size. The lamb salad is excellent as well. Don't forget to order a frozen Greek yogurt with baklava to go!",

      "text": "So one of my best friends claims she could bathe in Souvla salads she loves them so much. I had to see what all the hype was about and see if I too could find that much happiness in a salad. We ordered delivery on a weeknight. I went with the veggie salad- added white sweet potatoes-Greek style. Greek style is when they add French fries on top of your salad  because fries are the new healthy... salad was good but the potatoes and fries made it a little too potatoey and soggy. Mainly my fault for ordering but I was not as impressed as I thought I would be. Also tried out the honey baklava Greek yogurt. Strong flavor but still very good. Overall, I would suggest going to the restaurant to eat your food instead of delivery because it just isn't the same. Hopefully your Souvla experience will be more batheing-worthy than mine bath\n\nTake two: ordered Souvla again and this time I was well prepared for what to order. I went ahead and ordered the veggie salad again which comes with white sweet potatoes. Skipped the onions and olives, with dressing on the side. No Greek style either (fries on top). I added my own blueberries and avocado  + chia seeds. Top notch creation right there. Souvla is growing on me, but it's not quite bathe-worthy yet!",

Especially considering that this place typically has lines of hungry eaters looking to get their fix of those succulent Greek creations. We made it in around lunch time the day of our visit, luckily the line wasn't too long and their was a considerable amount of open seats available, though it still felt kind of cramped. Consider that your warning.\n\nAs for matters germane to the food, I can tell you they make one heck of a good chicken wrap. It felt like such guilt free eating but without the lack of flavor. The chicken was so flavorful and the accompanying fixings only made it better. Washed down with a Greek sparkling water - I tell ya, not a bad way to lunch.\n\nI did skip the Greek yogurt but for one, I wasn't aware it was one of the popular items, and two, I was completely satisfied with my meal. \nIf you ever find yourself in the Hayes Valley area, you def owe yourself a visit for what can be a delightfully light meal.",

The waiter brought out our food pretty quickly. I ordered the chicken salad which I absolutely loved. My salad had fresh orange slices and light dressing that tasted refreshing. My boyfriend ordered the lamb salad which was also tasty with very tender lamb however it was pretty greasy at the bottom.  We also ordered the garlic fries (how can you eat Mediterranean food without fries??!) and they were super crispy and fresh. The portions were pretty large so I had enough for a meal the next day!\n\nAs for dessert, my boyfriend ordered the baklava frozen yogurt because of all the positive reviews we've read. Tbh, I thought it was too sweet but then again, most baklava's are! The sweetness is balanced out when paired with the tartness of the Greek yogurt so it wasn't too bad! I definitely only had one bite though and he devoured the rest!",

I'm a firm believer that every gyro needs fries and this one sadly didn't come with it  it's also really messy to eat and I now have more than four too many grease stains on my pants\n\nAMBIENCE\n\nIt's a very casual place to dine and with very limited seating. Good if you are only meeting a friend or two, because there are not many tables and the inside is cramped. We were able to get seats outside but you sit along a long table shared with other patrons, and the seats are extremely difficult to move. \n\nSERVICE\n\nOnce you've waited in line and ordered, the wait to get your food is super short, less than 5 minutes. I really like that there's a little pickup window, especially since it's a small restaurant.",

      "text": "So glad we finally got to eat here! They do their own chicken rotisserie and the meat is very tender and tasty. Selection of meats are pork, lamb,\nChicken and there is a vegetarian option of white sweet potato. You can order either sandwiches or salads. We had the chicken and lamb sandwiches which were both delicious! Good sized portions and conducive to sharing. There are some sides too. I heard the fries are good. Wide selection of drinks. They have soft serve Greek yogurt which I need to try next time when I save room for dessert. Sandwich prices average $13. Good friendly service and clean interior.",

      "text": "I love Souvla! You can count on delicious food every single time and with every item on the menu. The menu itself is pretty small, but all tasty. There are three meat choices, which you can make into a sandwich or salad. Plus, a vegetarian option. There are also delicious sides like fries and soup. Plus, I live for the baklava soft serve!\n\nSouvla isn't cheap. It's very easy to spend $20 with just a sandwich and drink. If you want an appetizer and dessert, it can easily double.\n\nThe Mission District and NOPA Restaurants are much more spacious and comfortable. Unfortunately, the Hayes Valley Restaurant is smaller and more crowded--no room to breath and very loud during busy times. Out of the three, Hayes Valley is cozier and closer to more boutiques.\n\nBecause of the proximity, Hayes is my go-to, but the NOPA space is my favorite!",

      "text": "I'm a huge fan of this meditarranean restaurant! It's located in my favorite district; Hayes Valley. People are sitting outside of the shop, inside, and even by the windows!\n\nThis place smells of fresh roasted lamb, Greek scents, dessert, etc. I ordered their popular pork and lamb wraps which were super big. I couldn't believe how big these gyros actually were. For the price, you'll get a wrap that can feed a person and half. You have to pair your entree with Greek fries which are golden crisp fries topped with feta crumbles and parsley. I recommend ordering two sauces; Granch (greek yogurt and ranch) and the creamy garlic! It's legit bomb!! Two wraps and two greek fries ran me about $40 which seems pricey but honestly worth every penny. \n\nTheir meat is tender, juicy, and fresh off the grill. They don't skimp on any ingredients or flavor for that matter. Souvla has officially become one of my favorites in the city! I will start coming here for lunches whenever I'm around the area. There's no going around it.",

I was there for a quick lunch and had their Superior Farms Lamb Leg Salad and boy did I enjoy it! I would've loved to try one of their Frozen Greek Yogurts too, but I ran out of time.

      "text": "Souvla serves fast-casual Greek/Mediterranean food perfect for lunch or dinner.. or both!\n\nLet me start with the fries.  Oh man, the fries were really good.  I got it with the Garlic Dressing on the side (+$1), as recommended by the cashier.  It was well cut and seasoned, which was great, but it would be even better if I had more of that dressing!\n\nTheir Greek Yogurt was ah-mazing.  It's such a nice treat that is simple yet the flavors are so complex and the yogurt itself has a nice consistency.  My favorite one so far has to be the Baklava with Honey Syrup.  It comes with chunks of baklava and honey drizzle!  The Greek Olive Oil one was pretty salty and I don't see myself ordering that flavor again.  These yogurts are $5 and come in a cup, which is actually a decent amount of yogurt.\n\nThe Mary's Free-Range Chicken Salad ($14) Greek Style (+$1) was also delicious.  It came with a medley of different ingredients, including Mandarin oranges!  I enjoyed this salad and the portion was huge!  Greek style means adding fries on top, and I recommend doing this because the fries are so good and fries make everything even better!\n\nI ordered the Pork Shoulder Sandwich Wrap and was highly disappointed.  The meat was super dry and you could taste the dough flour of the wrap.  And how does one eat this without everything falling apart?  I think I'll be sticking to the salad versions and other meat options.\n\nOne thing I love is that you can see the meats roasting in the back.  Service is usually friendly, though my sister and I did have one instance where a woman was rude to us because we had not decided on what to order yet.  Besides that, they're pretty quick and welcoming for the most part.  This place can get pretty busy, but they get your food to you as quickly as possible.  They have a few locations around the city, so I recommend trying Souvla out at any of their locations if you're nearby.",

It ~was~ a warmer day in San Francisco, so I bet it usually isn't that unpleasant. Service was quite strange. We opted to sit outside and the staff member walked up to our table to tell us that our food was ready. I was so confused why they didn't just deliver the food to our table if they were gonna walk over to us in the first place. I've never been to another restaurant that's done this so I thought it was really weird. Gave me bad vibes.\n\nFOOD: At least the food came out super quick after placing our order...\n- My boyfriend ordered the chicken pita wrap, which was small, dry, and plain. There wasn't enough sauce or flavoring so each bite tasted mostly like plain pita bread or plain chicken. Though the protein was cooked well and the wrap tasted fairly fresh. 2/5\n- Lamb salad was pretty tasty. A lot better than the chicken wrap. The lamb was juicy and had a lot more flavor. 5/5\n- French fries were amazing though. Perfectly cooked and seasoned, they were thick fries that were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. I was surprised how long they stayed warm. 5/5\n\nExperience gave me weird vibes. At least the food was yummy. Just don't get a wrap.",

      "text": "Some of the highest quality fast casual I've had in San Francisco.  They have a pretty simple menu with lamb, chicken or pork in a sandwich or salad form; they really focus on doing those things well.  Limited seating so hopefully luck is on your side, but at least there is a nearby park to eat at if you must take your food to go.  \n\nLamb Sandwich: In San Francisco, my biggest complaint about a lamb shawarma or gyro sandwich is that the meat isn't properly crisped then thinly sliced when it should be.  The lamb here unabashedly comes in tender chunks without any pretense of trying to be a shawarma/gyro and I'm perfectly fine with that.  It's super tender and bursting with flavor.  Plus the generously creamy harissa yogurt sauce just takes it to the next level.\n\nChicken Salad: I'm really not a salad fan, but this salad could change me.  For one, they let meat, creamy sauce and cheese dominate the salad with veggies just making a guest appearance.  And then the chicken itself is heavenly.  Salty, cheesy, juicy, tender.  And the portion is ginormous.\n\nGreek Fries: Thick cut and crispy all around.  Not as mind-blowing as the mains, but still solid.",

      "text": "SOUvLa, you are the SOUL and very definition of San Francisco Greek-American casual comfort fare, and you never fail to disappoint. You are consistent and reliable - the constant in the sometimes hectic SF city life.  One of the remarkable places that sway me to say YES to haYES valley meet ups with friends on the weekend - when I'd rather be a couch potato and see what's new on uber eats. \n\nThings I like about Souvla -\n\n(1) Keeping things simple, and in doing so delivering high quality at no sacrifice to efficiency.  I like that the menu is simple.  \n\nFour proteins. Chicken. Lamb. Pork. Veg. \n\nTwo styles. Wrap or salad. \n\nAnd honestly, you can't go wrong with any combination. My favorites? Chicken salad and Veg wrap. \n\n(A) The Chicken Salad: Rarely do I eat salads, but love that this salad does not seem to be a salad, rather a more complex meal. It is not overly drenched in sauce, but a flavor burst of thoughtful ingredients - the herby fennel, with the citrus bust from naval orange, and the tartness of the pickled red onion, which complements the creamy feta cheese - all carefully tossed in \"granch\" dressing. \n\n(B) The Vegetable Wrap: I love the warm pita bread hugging the roasted white sweet potato like a comforting blanket around a most delicate angel skinned white potato baby, drizzled with garlic yogurt, sprinkled with the savory kalamanta olive, with the nutty aroma and crunch from the roasted walnut, on top which the pickled red onion, crisp pea shoots and mizithra cheese sit so delicately. \n\n(C) Juicy Potatoes and Greek Fries: I love the potato sides at Souvla, whether roasted or fried. It always compliments the main dish so well - and is fun to share. The juicy potatoes are so moist and tender - picking up the beautiful juices of the rotisserie drippings and oregano. The Greek fries are cooked to a perfect crisp, with every bite flavored with olive oil, lemon juice, parsley and mizithra cheese. Yum. \n\n(2) But my absolute favorite part? The creamy, rich Greek yogurt soft serve. \n\nI absolutely love the glorious Baklava Crumbles and honey syrup Greek yogurt. It is essentially a deconstructed warm, just out-of-the over baklava sitting on top creamy Greek soft serve yogurt that is rich and buttery to a fault. All drizzled in honey syrup to add that sticky honeyed element. It is hands down my favorite Greek frozen yogurt in the city. \n\nSouvla, I am souvlucky to have you in my life!",

My sister and I ordered the weekend brunch special lamb wrap with scrambled eggs (offer ends at 2pm) so we barely made it. The chicken salad and the Greek fries with the harissa mint dipping sauce ( you have choices of dipping sauces for your fries) portions are huge so one can basically share an order of each but can understand if one doesn't because it is that good! Let's start with the chicken salad - super fresh, perfectly seasoned rotisserie chicken and plenty of it in the salad. You get chicken with every single bite! Excellent! Now the Lamb wrap with scrambled eggs. Can we talk about the bread - fresh baked fluffy chewy pita bread! And the lamb again perfectly marinated and delicious! Very hearty meal - we put a lot of the hot sauce (not spicy) to compliment the wrap! It was EGG-cellent! Finally the fries! Hot with the right proportion of golden crisp! Love the dipping sauce! Service was super speedy quick! Crowded but was able to find seating right away! Great place with excellent delicious food!!",

You'll order at the bar and then find a seat, which is first come first serve and can be pretty busy. \n\nI love that you can get their dishes in either a salad or sandwich. I recommend the lamb or pork, I usually get the salad with a side of avgolemono soup, so yummy! No meal would be complete here without a side of their creek fries. I also highly recommend their frozen yogurt with baklava crumbles & honey syrup, order after you've eaten so it doesn't melt.  \n\nOverall, the food has a lot of flavor and is comparable to SF's often high prices. If you're coming here with kids, seating can be challenging. I recommend getting food to go and eating at a park. I would recommend giving Souvla's a try if you haven't already.",

But what really gets me is that the environment is not inviting and service needs to learn a thing or two about how they treat paying customers. For to-go orders, they should clearly state that seats are for dine-in customers only and to-go patrons should wait outside. As I sat (the restaurant wasn't overly crowded and had other open seats) the cashier stopped the line and came over and said that seats are for customers only. Customers only he kept on saying. Umm...I just ordered my meal (which was over $20 btw) and I am not a paying customer? Way to go. \n\nI would not wait in line for their food or come back any time soon. Sorry Souvla.",

And it's inexpensive but delicious fast food. Anyways we visited a couple of times in the last few months. This last time was after a nearby concert. They're open till 10 on weekdays so it's nice to find someplace open late-ish. The line was out the door but moved quickly. Food came out pretty quickly too. I have tried the chicken wrap during the first visit as well as the lamb wrap this most recent time. I'm not a huge fan of the chicken - it was white meat and a little dry (guess me being Asian, I like the dark meat). I had a bit of my bf's lamb during the first visit and it was good so I got it the second time and the lamb was dry and not as flavorful as I remember. Disappointed again. My bf got the pork shoulder wrap and I liked the bite I had of that. Skeptical to go again bc what if it's a disappointment again. For sides, we have tried the potatoes (concept sounds good but I found out it super oily and gross with not as much flavor as I thought) and the fries. I remember the fries being really good during the first visit but this time they were just ok. Barely any cheese, no parsley and could not taste the olive oil or lemon. \nI really want to like this place but they have not been very consistent. Next time I may just come back for the baklava Greek yogurt dessert.",

      "text": "I finally got to check out this fast casual Greek-inspired restaurant that is often hyped up by the tech people in SF. Famous for the Greek yogurt, this place hits the spot for Greek-inspired dishes, as the food is not necessarily authentic (from multiple sources). Prices are a bit high even though this place is in SF, but they do a great job presenting the dishes properly. Order at the counter and get a table marker, and then you choose anywhere open to sit. I ordered Mary's Free Range Chicken wrap, containing \"Granch\" (Greek ranch?), Mizithra cheese, onion, orange, and chicken. Chicken is pulled and somewhat juicy, though I can't really taste the Granch dressing. The onion and orange give the wrap a bit of a zest, but for the most part, the chicken doesn't really fit well with the other ingredients. This is definitely a more modern, fusion take of Greek food even as someone that is not Greek. The Greek fries are just fries with olive oil, lemon juice, parsley, and Mizithra cheese. It didn't taste anything special, and the citrus flavor from the lemon juice is extremely subtle. You can choose to add a dip for $1 extra, but we opted out of that. Pro tip though: you can dip the fries into the Greek yogurt for a twist. The Greek yogurt is probably the best item we ordered, as the wrap and fries failed to impress me at the very least. The yogurt is on par or as close as it gets to Ellenos Greek Yogurt in Seattle, but with a bit more creative flavors. The olive oil and flaky sea salt one I got mixes the savory with the sweet, exciting the taste buds a bit more. You can taste the freshness of the olive oil combining with the Greek yogurt, adding to the creaminess. The sea salt gives a nice contrast between the sweet and the salty, so I thoroughly enjoyed it. I would probably come back for the Greek yogurt only, but not the other dishes I ordered",

I've tried most of their flavors and the baklava is by far the best. Would stay away from the olive oil and sea salt flavor froyo.\n\nFor sides, the fries and juicy potatoes are both great. Juicy potatoes are made with the rotisserie drippings, so not healthy but definitely delicious. \n\nTheir solids are solid as well. Kinda pricey but large. I've had the pork one. I was hoping for a bit more meat on it but can't complain.\n\nOverall really like this place and will continue to go back.",

      "text": "This is a review just for their frozen Greek yogurt! \nWe got the yogurt with baklava and it was pretty delicious! The yogurt itself was only ever-so-slightly sweet, but still smooth and creamy - like a colder and better version of super market Greek yogurt. The baklava was quite sweet and provided a nice contrasting texture to the yogurt. The portion size was decent and fills up a small cup - definitely enough for one person or even to share between two! Priced at $5 which is reasonable for SF, though I wish they gave us more for the price. \n\nI would love to come again and try Souvla's food or any different toppings on the yogurt.",

      "text": "Gratifying food. \n\nLamb gyro was bomb. If you're into tzatziki order it with garlic sauce on the side. It's a must. I would prefer the bread to be softer. Will order as a salad next time. Quintessential Greek fries. Picture perfect lunch. \n\nBut let's be honest... the best, most rational reason to come here is for their Greek froyo with baklava and honey. Smooth texture, melt in your mouth yogurt with luscious honey and tender baklava. Ooooooooo yeahhhhh!!\n\nHowever, some things need improving:\n\n1. Cunning salesmanship. When I ordered the garlic fries the cashier told me the fries came with a choice of three sauces. When I checked my email receipt I saw I was charged for the dipping sauce. Meh. \n\n2. Service. I tipped 20% and encountered weird interactions when requesting items or asking questions.\n\n3. The froyo center is hollow. They could be a little more generous and fill the cup properly. \n\nHighly recommend take out. Avoid lunch hours. Not the venue for an intimate, cozy meal. This place embodies the pure flavors of Greece but in a well groomed, glossy, hipster fashion.",

      "text": "This is one of my favorite places to get a salad in SF! They dress it really well and there are different meat options to choose from. The Chicken is probably my favorite out of the three, but the Pork and Lamb are also really good! They also have a Vegetarian option. \n\nAll the meats are spit-fired and go really nice with the dressings and toppings, but sometimes there are pieces of meat that are dry and over cooked. I don't always get the Greek Fries but they are a great side to share! I recommend getting one of the sauces with the fries, I like the Garlic Sauce. \n\nThe portion sizes here are great but if you have room after your salad or sandwich/wrap, they have great Frozen Greek Yogurt. I've had the one with Baklava Crumbles and Honey and it was really good, not too sweet with just the right amount of tartness!",

The frozen Greek yogurt was still a little too sweet for my liking but it was tart enough to contrast the sticky sweetness of the baklava bits. I wish the baklava crumbles had a higher nut to pastry ratio but it was still yummmmmyyyyy!\n\nAll in all, an interesting concept that is pretty well-executed. There are a couple minor things they could improve on (see above), but it's definitely well worth a try!",

I often frequent the one on Divisadero. \n\nFOOD: Feeling healthier with the chicken salad, I must admit, the \"Granch\" dressing they provide definitely makes the whole salad tasty (but then you wonder ... is it still as healthy?). That aside, the salad has the right textures, tasty dressing, and perfect portion size. You also can't leave without getting some frozen Greek yogurt, which my favorite is half cherry and half olive oil. It's pure bliss. \n\nSERVICE: Speedy! \n\nA fast casual Greek restaurant, Souvla definitely has the right recipe down for San Franciscans.",

      "text": "We needed a quick bite to eat before attending a pre-ballet lecture/talk at the War Memorial Opera House and Souvla fit the bill. It's casual (order at the counter and find a seat), but the restaurant's decor is modern and the vibe friendly. The location can't be beat too. It's only a few blocks from the Ballet and Symphony, and close to bars, coffee shops, etc! \n\nThe DH (dear husband) and I both ordered the Pork Shoulder Sandwich ($11), and Greek Fries ($4) and the Souvla Side Salad ($5) to share. The pork sandwich had minted yogurt, pickled red onions, cherry tomatoes, cucumber and feta in it. The sandwich was okay (needed a little more spice for me), but it was very hearty. I almost wished I'd ordered the salad instead which costs a dollar more. It would have been a lighter dinner. Careful with that sandwich! The juices from the meat and dressing dripped and almost got on my outfit! \n\nI actually enjoyed the fries and salad more than the sandwich. Even though the fries were not as good as Opa Fries, they're nicely seasoned and they're not too thick. I loved the salad! Loved how refreshing it was. I would definitely order my choice of protein on a salad next time. The sandwich was too heavy for me! \n\nWe didn't order dessert as we had to leave and walk back to the WMOH. They do have Frozen Greek Yogurt that you can choose to top with baklava and other sweet toppings. \n\nSodas, Greek wine and beer complete their menu. We just went with water as I always grab a glass of wine at the Ballet before the performance. \n\nSouvla is a good option before the Ballet, Opera or Symphony if you're wanting something quick and affordable!",

      "text": "I love Souvla and their salads. Whenever I'm craving a salad, Souvla is my go to. I got here about 45 minutes before closing time and it was surprising still packed. The menu is super simple and opted for the chicken salad and the pork shoulder salad. Note: you can also get these options in a sandwich form too (it's a little cheaper, but the salad is a lot less messier to eat)\n\nBoth salads came out super quick. The chicken salad never disappoints me! The chicken is flavorful and juicy af and goes well with the rest of the salad ingredients. Favorite part is definitely the mandarin oranges! The pork shoulder salad was really good too, although I did find a pork a little on the dry side .. don't think I would get the pork shoulder salad again though. \n\nHighly recommend Souvla if you're in the area and want something light to eat.",

      "text": "The Greek yogurt with baklava and honey is to die for. The very first time I came to Souvla was off a recommendation to try the Greek yogurt, and I have been in love ever since. \n\nThe second time I came, I got the chicken sandwich and decided to eat it at the little park around the corner (Patricia's Green). I love love love rotisserie chicken but am often afraid that the white meat turns out too dry, and the first few bites of my sandwich were just that. Fortunately, the navel oranges were so sweet and juicy they really brought the chicken to life! Halfway through my meal I was struggling to take graceful bites - it's a very big sandwich! - and dropped two orange slices to the ground, delighting nearby pigeons. Towards the end of my sandwich, the chicken was sitting in its own juices and luckily made for flavorful last bites. \n\nI then turned to my friend, who had gotten the pork shoulder, and took a bite of his sandwich. Good God, the tomatoes and cucumber together made the most delicious combination with pita and pork.\n\nWhen I go back again, I think I'll try the lamb or pork, but no matter what I'm saving enough stomach to get the Greek yogurt with baklava.",

      "text": "I had a former coworker who got this in her regular dinner time rotation, but I never had the chance to check it out with her. On a quiet night in the office, I was thinking of her and missing her usual choice of restaurants, so I decided to check it out. \n\nI got the lamb salad and a Greek yogurt froyo. The lamb salad, while on the pricier side of things, was also on the heftier side of things. The lamb was moist and of the stringy variety, which isn't really my thing, but I still appreciated how it seemed to show up in every bite in large chunks. The flavor of sometimes strong ingredients (like pickled red onions and beets) were moderated by the yogurt dressing. Not the lightest salad, but it won't weigh you down too much. 3.75/5.\n\nAs an ice cream lover, many people had told me to check out the froyo here. It's light, with a brightness from the yogurt. The baklava and honey were warm and provided some texture (not really my thing, but I know that other people like it).  I would have preferred more ice cream and less baklava, but to each their own. 4/5.\n\nA 3.6 for me.\n--\n\nLiterally the next day, we get this as a group order for lunch, so here I am checking out the chicken salad with yams, in addition to the yams.\n\nThe chicken was a little bit dry, but just as with the lamb, they were generous with the portion size. Good chicken flavor. The mitzrah cheese adds a little more texture but not really any flavor to the salad. 3.5/5 on the chicken salad. The yams are straight out of a health food lover's dream-- just straight yams, well done. Those roasted potatoes are SO salty, but boy would I get them again. So velvety there isn't really any texture to them. 3.75/5 on the potatoes.",

      "text": "Out of all the Mediterranean restaurants I've been to, I think I enjoy the bowls of Souvla the most! Given your choice of protein, the diced meat is served on a bed of delicious kale lightly marinated in olive oil. The bowl is bursting with flavor, from the onions, feta cheese crumbles, and hearty cherry tomatoes. Sometimes, Mediterranean cuisine can be too oily, but Souvla's dishes are light and filling! The meat is actually cooked in front of you in an oven! I could tell that the owners went for the \"contemporary kitchen\" layout, featuring light wood shelving, minimalist décor, and small pots of plants. Overall, there is a clean, modern look to the restaurant, making it a trendy place to eat. \n\nUnfortunately, I would not recommend the iced tea. It comes in a bottle, tastes like artificial tea with preservatives, and is quite pricey. Along with that, the other drawback would be the small, cramped space that leads to competitive seating. It will definitely be tricky to fit a big group here... This is not a comfortable \"sit and dine\" restaurant, since there are basically only bar counter top seating and other high table seats on hard, metallic seats. Even though there are some benches in the park nearby to eat, I think the restaurant could make more efforts incentivizing people to take their time in the restaurant, socialize with friends, and have some drinks over good food. Also, there are not a lot of options on the menu, so Souvla would not be a stop for those cosmopolitan foodies searching for exquisite, complex food.",

      "text": "Yuppified Daphne's. \n \nDon't get me wrong, I enjoy yuppified food and have no problem paying a premium price, if justified.\n\nSouvla's marketing is on point with great buzz words on their menu (e.g. \"American Homestead Pork Shoulder\", \"Superior Farms Lamb Leg\", \"Harissa-Spiked Yogurt\", etc.) and hefty prices to match. If I'm going to pay 2x the price for a chicken gyro wrap, the chicken better be free-range and Mary, herself better be tending to them--am I right?\n\nLet's start with the good. I like that Souvla's menu is very simple. Choose a protein (pork, chicken, lamb, or veggie), then decide whether you want a wrap ($10-$13) or a salad ($11-$14). Make it a combo meal with sides ($4-$6): fries, potatoes, side salad, or soup. Have a sweet tooth? End your meal with Greek froyo ($4-$5). They also have wine and beer so you can get your drank on. \n\nOrder at the counter, get a number, and your food will be delivered to you. The space is tiny, loud, and you will have to hover for seats. Luckily, there's a quick turnover. My co-worker and I found seats in 2 minutes and received our food 2 minutes after. Great for people who are pressed for time.\n\nNow, the not so good. We paid $40 for one wrap, one salad, and one order of fries to share (including tax + tip). Expensive for a casual, \"fast food\" lunch with no waiter service. At these prices, I expected the food to be Greekgasmic.\n\nI appreciate Souvla's use of fresh, high-quality ingredients. Given how simple the menu is, it's unfortunate the food was less than mediocre. \n\nMy Superior Farms Leg Lamb Wrap ($13): bitly.com/a/bitlinks was superiorly dry and bland. I enjoyed the warm, thick, and fluffy pita bread but it was filled with flavorless, tough, and chewy cubes of lamb (texture of well done top round). The lamb was devoid of any spices. The yogurt sauce was concentrated at the opening end of the pita so I kept reaching for the bottle of hot sauce on our table to add flavor and moisture to the rest of the wrap. I ended up using half the bottle. \n\nMy co-worker said the chicken in the Mary's Organic Chicken Salad ($14) was dry and bland as well. This seems to be the common complaint among other yelpers with their proteins.\n\nI couldn't help but think one could buy nearly 3 whole rotisserie chicken from Costco for $14. Yikes, I sound like a cheap phuck but at least Costco's rotisserie chicken is well-seasoned and moist. \n\nThe saving grace were the side of Greek Fries ($4). They were piping hot, deliciously crunchy, and fluffy on the inside. The fries are supposed to be topped with olive oil, lemon juice, parsley, mizithra cheese but we barely got a smidge of each. You have to pay an extra $1 for a tiny container of dipping sauce--what the heezy?!? If you're going to nickel and dime customers, just charge $5 and include the sauce. It's an inconvenience to later find out that ketchup is not available and have to stand in line again (and that line can get long) just to buy the dipping sauce.\n\nI doubt I would return to Souvla, nor would I recommend it to anyone looking for a legit Greek meal. It's overpriced and the flavors are dumbed down.\n\nMaybe Uncle Jesse will go into the restaurant biz in Fuller House: usm.ag/1Mkqe4I? Wouldn't mind a bite of his gyro. Oops, did I say that?",

      "text": "The perfect spot for a casual dinner in Hayes Valley. When we first walked in I was struck by the clean but trendy interior design. We were there around 7 pm on a Friday and there was a line out the door, but it went fast since you order at the counter.\n\nWe got two wraps - one chicken and one lamb - plus fries. Everything was delicious - especially the fries. It's easy to make fries but not easy to do them well - Souvla does them well.\n\nEven though it was busy we were able to grab a counter seat before our food was ready. After we ate we went back to the counter and ordered two frozen Greek yogurts with Baklava crumbles. So good! I loved the tartness of the Greek yogurt. Will definitely be back.",

We opted for their breakfast gyro and so I don't think I can speak to their entire menu since the scrambled eggs weren't exactly great and needed slat, but the lamb and the frozen yogurt with sea salt and olive oil was wonderful. The Greek fries also looked superb and I am still kicking myself for not ordering them. \n\nGood beer and friendly, albeit chaotic, atmosphere. Even though the cashier was a little scatterbrained, the overall service and expediency was quite great. Will definitely revisit on the next SF trip.",

The kitchen is also pretty fast at getting your food ready. \n\nI usually get the pork shoulder sandwich. The seasoning is pretty good and I like the cucumber and the tomatoes in the sandwich. The portion of the sandwich is also pretty filling, I could probably save half of it for another meal if I wanted to. \n\nSouvla also sells Greek yogurt dessert if you still have the stomach for it afterwards. There are also 4 flavors for the Greek yogurt. I prefer the olive oil and salt flavor because the salt balances out  the sweet and sour taste of the yogurt and the olive oil just adds an interesting taste to it. My close second is elderflower honey because it is not too sweet and kind of taste like how I would usually eat my Greek yogurt. I did not really like the baklava one because of the texture of the crumbles and the overall taste is just too sweet.",

      "text": "Souvla has been on my bookmarks a few weeks now after I read about it on an SF food blog (of course...)! I haven't been to many Greek restaurants so I was excited to give Souvla a try after reading so many glowing reviews. \n\nYou order first, pay, then find a table. The menu is simple and straightforward: you choose your protein, and if you want it in sandwich/souvlaki form or salad form. \n\nI've tried the lamb, the pork, and the chicken in both sandwich and salad form, and the pork salad is by far my favorite!! The lamb is cut into cubes (not thin slices like traditional gyros) and is super tender and moist. The chicken sandwich/salad has the best toppings in my opinion, with the oranges and pink pickled onions. But the pork shoulder definitely takes the cake for me as the best meat!! It's seasoned and cooked perfectly. \n\nThe Greek fries are thick and crunchy, and were seasoned with lemon juice, olive oil, and cheese! Also you can get your sandwich or salad \"Greek style\" for $0.50 extra, and they add fries INSIDE your sandwich or salad!!\n\nYou will be full if you finish your meal because the portions are huge. The sandwiches may look small in pictures but they definitely are not! Souvla puts a large amount of meat in both the sandwiches and the salads. I can't wait to come back and try the pork shoulder!! Mmmmm!",

We decided to drive to Souvla on a Tuesday night, and it was still SUPER busy around 8pm. Although there were a good amount of people waiting outside for their to-go orders, the line to place the order was luckily short, and we were able to place our order quickly. They made our greek yogurt on the spot, so we were in and out in 5 minutes. We were able to stand outside to eat it, and it was delicious!! I just wished they layered the baklava crumbles and syrup, since it's too tempting to eat them all at once, and then you're left with a lot of greek yogurt.\n\nOverall, it's totally worth braving the crowds at Souvla to try their greek yogurt, and I will have to come back to try their food also! Parking can be very tough in this area, especially on the weekends.",

      "text": "Souvla is the typical restaurant you'd find in Hayes Valley. Super cute, small, quaint, with a huge line out the door. \n\nThey have great salads, sandwiches, and meats. Nothing feels TOO heavy which is amazing! If ordering for one, their portions are usually too large to order multiple dishes (IE, french fries + salad), and I rarely am able to finish the salad alone. \n\nI like ordering salads \"Greek style\" where they will put a few extra fries on top! Leg lamb salad is my favorite, but even the pork shoulder + sweet potato is also delicious!\n\nIn term so yogurts, I'm a big of the baklava greek yogurt (another very popular one is the olive oil + sea salt) which IMO blends too many flavors together. I studied abroad in Greek for a summer, and have been hard pressed to find greek yogurt comparable to ones in Athens, but this one certainly hits the mark!\n\nRating 4/5 because while I will always be a return customer / huge fan, seating is hard to come by and while the food is delicious, its nothing truly to \"blow you away\".",

It is kind of difficult getting a seat for 4 people, especially because each party leaves an empty seat in between other parties on the counter.\nI got the pork sandwich and it's like a wrap. It had pork, cheese, cucumbers, and tomatoes. The veggies tasted fresh and really made the sandwich taste better. The sandwich also didn't seem that big, but I was stuffed after finishing it! I also got the garlic fries which had no garlic flavor what so ever, but it tasted sooo good with the greek yogurt dip that was given to us. I would definitely get the fries again, but probably just regular fries. Lastly, I tried the greek frozen yogurt and it was so good! Tasted like tarte froyo with some extra flavor from the syrup, baklava, or olive oil.",

      "text": "Souvla is a great, fast-casual spot for Greek food.  While it is on the pricier side for fast-casual, the quality is worth the price.  The location in Hayes Valley is tiny and can have a line out the door during peak lunch and dinner hours but the front staff is quite efficient at taking orders and getting people through the line. \n\nThe perimeter of the dining space has either high top tables or bar seating; on the right side of restaurant, there is a long table for family style seating.  The décor has a rustic but airy and modern feel to it.\n\nThe menu has two types of main dishes: salad or sandwich.  You then select pork, chicken, lamb, or vegetable for your salad/sandwich.  I have tried both the salad and sandwich in each variety (I eat Souvla a little too often), and my favorite combination is the chicken salad.  I love making my chicken salad \"Greek style\" (+$1), which means adding fries on top.  The Greek fries as a side/appetizer are always a table favorite.  If you're craving sweets, definitely grab a cup of their frozen Greek yogurt.  My favorite flavor is either sour cherry or baklava.  Almost everything I've eaten at Souvla is delicious but skip their Greek iced tea.  It comes in a bottle and tastes like what I imagine bong water to be like.",

Apparently the yogurt, which I didn't sample, is to die for. I wouldn't die any time soon for my ingestion.\n\nThere were only four main dishes on the menu and none of them were SOUVLA-aki...I guess that's what happens when you assume things.\n\nAnyway, I was hoping for a broader menu since I ADORE Greek food and don't have ANY decent options near where I live. I ordered the lamb and it was chewy. Not flavorless, but definitely not flavorful. \n\nI'd have to sum up my dining experience as, \"I'm hungry and paid money for it so I'll definitely eat it.\" \n\nA great sauce may have taken it over the border from mediocre to pretty damn good. But alas, I was too hungry to find the needed fixes and once done, I was very \"meh\" about the entire experience. I'm not really inspired to try it again (except maybe the yogurt) since there are so many better food options in the area.",

I took two friends here and ordered 2 chicken sandwiches and one lamb plus 2 soups.   I also made the mistake of giving a 15% tip though this is not a full service restaurant. The total cost was $65.\n\nHere is what was right with the place:\n\n1) Workers were responsive and professional.\n\nHere is what is wrong with this place:\n\n1) Pita for all 3 sandwiches was too dry.\n2) The lamb sandwich have very little meat.\n3) Way too much cheese.\n4) Though the lemon grass soup was pretty good, mine had a small hair at the bottom; not very appealing.\n5) Crowd: Mostly young under 30 crowd. I have always felt that to appreciate good food you need to have spent time experiencing  different cuisines. Young people in my opinion are not the best to review food. \n\nA traditional Gyro fast food joint would be a better value.\n\nFinally, WHY ARE YOU SENDING MY PERSONAL RECEIPT TO MY WORK EMAIL?  I don't want to mix professional and personal.

      "text": "The weeknight line out the door at Souvla caused me to walk by before circling back.  This was a place I'd wanted to try for a long time and why not let that time be now?  Smart choice, as that line is where you place your order and I learned that it moves quickly.  \n\nSouvla's simple concept is killing it right now.  With 3 SF locations they're on the tip of becoming that thing that yelpers hate, a \"chain'\", but actually they're the type of chain I welcome.  I was quite happy with my salad made with free range chicken, pickled red onions, pea shoots, and more ($13), and their frozen Greek yogurt ($4-$5) with assorted intriguing toppings is a perfect inexpensive dessert.    \n\nThe concept here is straightforward, with chicken, lamb, pork, and vegetables being offered in (lavash) sandwich or salad format, all in the $10-$14 range.  The menu sources the origins of the proteins so you're not just staring down at \"pork\" but rather, \"American Homestead Pork Shoulder\".  It's the sort of virtuous menu which gives the impression you're getting fresh, responsibly sourced products.  The whole place, especially with the crowds it attracts, feels very \"now\".\n\nSouvla's formula is one that several other small, local chains are offering.  Though completely different, the price point and service model call to mind The Grove and Blue Barn Gourmet, both local small chain enterprises.  Of the 3, I liked Souvla the best as result of their style, their menu, and their food.  \n\nDid I like everything?  My dining partner ordered his salad with a protein of Superior Farms Lamb Leg which I tasted and didn't at all care for.  It took him until midway through his meal to reach the same conclusion.  Neither of us would again order the lamb.  \n\nSouvla is a vibrant hive of activity.  I'd happily return for another salad (this time off-menu \"Greek-style\" which translates into \"topped with fries\") and frozen Greek yogurt.",

Personally, I would just order one and share to enjoy the fatty carb. One disappointing thing is, even though the sight of the juicy rotating meat in the oven and the smell really draw customers in, the meat in the pita wrap is always so dry, and lack meat flavor. The sitting situation is not particular comfortable either in the restaurant. \n\nIf there's a short line, grab some yogurt, juice potatoes, and continue shopping in Hayes Valley :)",

But surprisingly this odd combo worked. They also have hot sauce at the tables which is really good. My friend tried the Frozen Greek Yogurt with Baklava pieces - I snagged a bite and it was delicious. The tartness of the yogurt with the sweetness of the pieces was a perfect bite, leaving the palate guessing. Definitely a cool spot to check out!",

We got the pork wrap and a lamb salad, one honey yogurt, one baklava yogurt, french fries and juicy potatoes. I was slightly disappointed with my lamb as it was dry and tough. The pork was good. The french fries were phenomenal. We got the garlic sauce to go with it. The juicy potatoes were good. But the fries were the bomb. Go with that if you have to choose. The yogurts were really good too. I guess I'd have to come back and try the lamb again.",

Disclaimer: I've only tried their frozen greek yogurt for dessert after lunch but it was REALLY GOOD frozen greek yogurt.\n\nThe frozen greek yogurt comes in 4 different topping variations: 1) Sour cherry, 2) Olive Oil, 3) Baklava & 4) Honey. I got their frozen greek yogurt with baklava and it's probably one of my top favorite frozen treats I've had yet. The yogurt was more on the rich and creamy side with the perfect amount of sweetness and tartness. The baklava had a nice flaky and buttery texture to it. But what impressed me the most was the baklava's flavor. The combination of spices (it reminded me of cinnamon, cardamom and maybe nutmeg) that they used shocked my tastebuds and was an excellent addition to my frozen greek yogurt.\n\nThe place itself is pretty casual and gets packed real fast. Can't wait to come back to try out their food though because their gyros and fries looked super good that I regret not making lunch plans here in the first place.",

Also, because of the size, coming with a big group could be a challenge. \n\nFood was good, staff was nice, next time I'd just get my meal to go from the start and avoid the stress of finding a place to sit.",

I wish it had more flavor, sauce or a kick to it! Overall the sandwich was bland and felt dry. The fries (not featured) were pretty good, but the baklava frozen yogurt was the best!! I asked for more baklava on top and the individual graciously gave me more without charge which was super nice of them! The vibe is also fun, especially since this location is in hayes valley, you can chill outside and enjoy your meal and company!",

      "text": "Souvla's been on my radar forever, but the long lines scared me away. What if it wasn't as delicious as the hype made it to be?! Given the amount of praise Souvla gets, it definitely wouldn't have been difficult for it to be over-talked. However, I'm happy to report that Souvla did not disappoint.\n\nGiven the lines, get here early if you want to eat here, as it definitely fills up. I came at around 530 pm on a Monday because I was super hungry! There was only one table free, so I quickly ordered and snagged it. There weren't too many people in line, so my chicken salad and fries came quickly.\n\nThis salad. is. the. bomb. It tastes amazing and is super refreshing. Your taste buds and body will thank you for giving it yummy nutrients. No lie. And, if you thought it couldn't get any better, it's also super filling! I devoured my meal like a savage.\n\nWhile my experience was pretty great, I gotta emphasize again that it's all a matter of timing! Fast forward 30 minutes and there was a line out the door. It stayed that way for the next hour, when we finally vacated. There was never an empty table, and in fact, there were people waiting around for tables for at least 20 minutes. Luckily, it seems like with long lines it takes longer for the food to come out, allowing people enough time to hope for an empty table before their food is served.",

There was only street parking in the area so that made it hard to park there but that is to be expected in San Francisco. I got the free-range chicken wrap with a side of the garlic greek fries. The good was good don't get me wrong, but I don't think it lived up to the hype for me. The chicken wrap was slightly dry and I think it would be better with some more of the sauce in there. The hot sauce that came at the table was not hot at all. And the garlic fries were not garlicky at all. That being said the chicken was fresh and the fries were perfectly crispy. I would come back but I do not think that this place is as good as everyone says it is. Perhaps they were having an off day.",

      "text": "A cute, very Bay Area - esque Mediterranean restaurant. I came to the Hayes Valley location, since I was meeting some college friends here, but I believe there are other locations throughout SF. \n\nHere's what we ordered: \n\nFrozen Greek Yogurt with Baklava Crumbles and Honey Syrup - the tanginess and creaminess of the greek yogurt goes so well with the crispy filo layers of the baklava crumbles and the sweet and sticky honey syrup. I can see why people would come for this dessert alone, esp on a relatively warm SF afternoon like when I was there. \n\nGreek Fries - salty, crunchy, fried potato deliciousness - what more could you honestly ask for? They top theirs with some olive oil, lemon juice, and cheese that makes for an extra salty and acidic punch that helps to make it an interesting french fry to snack on. \n\nRoasted White Sweet Potato - this is a great vegetarian dish that has all your classic Mediterranean flavors in a light, refreshing summer-y dish. \n\nThere was a little bit of a wait at this location, mainly because this location doesn't have much seating. They do have some indoor and outdoor seating, but as with most downtown restaurants, there just isn't a lot of chairs, so if you want to - take it to go and enjoy it while sitting in the lawn/park area right across the street.",

My brother said it was the closest food he's tasted that compared to overseas.\n\nAtmosphere: crowded! Sunday at 3:30 there's a line out the door! The line takes a while, but once you order it only takes 5-10 minutes for the food to come out. Tip: order a Greek yogurt with baklava while you wait! You won't regret it! \n\nGreek yogurt with baklava: absolutely the creamiest tart ice cream I've ever had. It's tartness is perfectly balanced by the sweet crispy baklava. It's a match made by heaven. We loved it so much, we came back an hour later for a second one!\n\nPork shoulder sandwich: extremely juicy! A little greasy for my taste, but never the less delicious! It comes packed with so much meat! It's a big portion and depending on how hungry you are can be shared between two people.\n\nLamb sandwich: also juicy and delicious! Comes with chunky meat instead of thing strips like many other Mediterranean places. Less greasy in my opinion too!\n\nFries: even their fries are delicious! Every bite is perfectly crisp on the outside but still soft on the inside. I can't quite explain it but they were the best fries I've ever had.\n\nOverall:\nAtmosphere: 3\nService: 5\nTaste: 5\n\nDefinitely worth the wait! Had to give five stars for the food experience on its own!",

My friend wasn't super into Mediterranean food, but she was sold on the lamb wrap too. Really generous portions. \n\nThe fries are the greatest.

We also shared the Greek Fries, which was flavorful and crispy. \n\nWe went to the Hayes St. location, which gets crazy busy during lunch time. Service is wonderful--friendly staff and food comes out quickly. The restaurant is small with a few tall tables and a communal table.

I am only able to eat 1/2 a salad each time and always always always take home the 2nd half. I told him this, and he responded saying the containers are part of a program where they don't want the containers to be left in the streets, and then walked off (what?!). The frustrating part was that he disregarded my reason. Not to mention, they had plenty of seating when I was there so it wasn't a space issue. So disappointed as I've been a loyal customer. Still a big fan of the food.\n\nOld Review:\nJust adore this restaurant. Food is filling, fresh, and healthy. Quality and service are consistently great. Atmosphere is bright, chic, and super clean.\n\nMy favorites are the lamb salad, all the Greek yogurts, and the Greek sodas.\n\nPerfect for lunch or a quick dinner. You order at the counter, grab your own seat, they bring the food out to you. \n\nDuring lunch and dinner, seats fill up very quickly and there may be a wait to sit (5-20 min).",

      "text": "Ever looking for a good refreshing salad that is healthy + flavorful, SOUVLA is definitely the way to go. This is my go to spot for salads when i'm craving for something \"healthy\" and tasty. The portion is huge and they put ample amounts of meat into the salad. You will feel stuffed when you come out- in a good way.  I like to usually get the salad with pork shoulder.\n\nTheir menu is quite simple, they have 3 types of main meat that can be made to a wrap or salad.  If you come with a friend, you may want to get a wrap cut in half and a salad split in half. Don't be shy because they are very nice with their service. They will help you split it into 2 bowls and plates.\n\nThey have cheap Rose with generous pouring for those who may want to grab a drink while enjoying their meal. Even though the price is cheap, it don't mean that it tastes bad. It's actually quite refreshing and tasty!",

As I only wanted a little something, this was more than enough. Wish I had tried the yogurt. I did have a bite of the pork sandwich. My friend hated it, but the bite I had was fine. \n\nDefinitely will be going back. And wonderful that there is the park nearby to take food to once the weather begins heating up.",

      "text": "I've been dreaming of Souvla ever since I went while visiting San Fran last month. After a recommendation from a close friend who lives in the Bay area, my sister and I ended up at this location at primo time on a Friday evening and still had the best time. \n\nSeating/space is limited in this small shop but the line moves quickly and if you can't find a seat, take it to go and hit the park nearby!\n\nI like the concept here of a super simple menu starting you with four options (pork, chicken, lamb or veggie) and the choice of on pita or on salad. Sides are a la carte and wine is just red, rose, white, or bubbles. They also featured a greek beer and a few sodas. I love not having to stand there and act like I know the wines on the list while ultimately choosing the second least expensive option. So rose it was!  \n\nBoth my sister and I got salads so I can't speak for the pita but they looked awesome. I think the salads are the way to go though. This bowl was jam packed with kale, veggies, pork for me, pickled onion, feta, cucumber and so much yummy yogurt sauce. Piled on the kale, it didn't feel too guilty! \n\nI was so full after this meal that I couldn't quite swing the frozen greek yogurt but after seeing people with cups of this the rest of the weekend, I really wish I had made room. \n\nWe lucked out and scored a bar spot right in front of the rotating poultry. The noise level was really manageable for how packed they were! I highly suggest a visit here and am already ready to return.",

Fennel and mandarins was a nice touch, they were definitely needed to add an element of flavor because the chicken was juicy but lacked flavor. On the other hand, It was huge so it's understandable why it was $14 but I do wish that it came fries or something, because when I'm trying to eat lunch I'm not trying to break the bank. However it was a great portion size, i was able to save half for later and I feel like the flavors got even better as time went on.

I recently discovered Souvla and have been wondering where it has been all my life! There is a choice of pork, chicken, lamb, and sweet potato (vegetarian) protein with a different assortment of greens with each protein. My favorite combination is the chicken salad with fennel, naval orange, pickled red onion dressed with a delectable and light dressing. If you don't want to be as healthy, you can get your salad in sandwich form or add fries, soup, roasted potatoes, and treat yourself with one of their specialty frozen yogurts! This is a perfect place for a quick bite or takeout meal. The only slight problem is that the space can get very packed and it might be harder to grab seating especially on weekends and lunch hour. Additionally, it can get very pricey if you do more add ons and adding drinks. Other than this, Souvla is a very reliable establishment.",

Uhmm... what to expect: constant lines, $15 salads, amazing frozen Greek yogurt, solid interior design. \n\nI've been to several of the locations across SF and they really don't vary much. While each layout is different, they are very clearly a chain with their recipes and layouts down to a science. The Hayes location has the counter right at the front so the line always spills out onto the street and the rotisserie is visible on the back wall. There's limited seating and a lot of it is semi-communal so it's not a place I'd suggest going to for an early date. Sadly, many new Tinder couples don't agree. \n\nAnyway, the food: the salads are great. The frozen Greek yogurt is to die for. The wraps are meh, and as for the sides, I've only had the juicy potatoes but they are quite good.",

I got the chicken gyro sandwich and my boyfriend, the lamb. Both sandwiches were very delicious. We also got a side of Greek fries. Honestly, we could've shared one sandwich because the sandwiches were so large!\n\nI really like the idea that you can get any of the sandwich options but turn it into a salad. Of course on my first go, I HAD to get the sandwich but next time I will try the salad. I also love that they service beer and wine.\n\nThe place is really small and always has a ton of people so it was great to go for lunch. They also sell frozen Greek yogurt with a few different toppings. The topping options are: Baklava pieces, tart cherries or olive oil with salt. I was way too full the first time but one night we stopped by after dinner for dessert. I got the Froyo with baklava and my boyfriend the olive oil w/salt. Mine was definitely the winning choice. I don't even normally like baklava but this dessert was SO satisfying. The olive oil and salt wasn't layered so all the salt was all on top which kind of blew your palette away. I've had ice cream with olive oil and salt before and it was damn delicious so  I think with a little tweaking it could be really good.\n\nDefinitely recommend!",

Yeah, this place is on the pricier side; would recommend getting the wrap over the salad ($1 cheaper), it's a better deal and probably more satisfying.\n\nThe chicken was forgettable.

Fries were just slightly better than your average garlic fries. Decent lunch spot for the wraps.",

      "text": "The food at Souvla is pretty good but the greek frozen yogurt is even better. Most of their bowls have some yogurt in it along with lots of veggies and your choice of meat. It's a very nice blend of the different food groups. \n\nThe frozen yogurt though is on another level. The texture, flavor, and sweetness-level is much better than other froyo places (maybe because this is made with Greek yogurt?). They have a variety of toppings and I can't wait to try all of them. I got the sea salt and olive oil, which added a nice flavor to the yogurt. Be sure to spread out the sea salt though! When they add it on top, it's pretty concentrated, so my first bite was quite salty. \n\nThe only downside about this place is the size. I came here on a Wednesday evening and it was packed! The line moved pretty quickly but we had to wait quite a bit for a table and it was very crammed. The employees constantly had to tell me to move my chair so they can carry ingredients from the back.",

      "text": "Every once in a while, I try a place everyone else is raving about and find myself shrugging my shoulders in a state of meh-ness. Oh who am I kidding? It happens all the time, and then I get all snarky when people hate on something that they have deemed less than satisfactory. Well, I've now tried Souvla, and I must say I don't really get the hype. It's a shame because I like the bare-bones, In-n-Out concept used - focus on three meats, add a veggie option (sweet potato, not tofu, in this case) and throw in some froyo to get more walk-by traffic. I think a lot of my meh reaction came from the poor way they handled the crowds there. Which basically means not at all.\n\nThe compact place crowds quickly, and the overflow is left to the busy sidewalk where the variety of Hayes Valley life forms gets all in your face. From the shrieking loon smelling of urine to the smug, entitled bitch tapping her iPhone expecting me to get out of her way. It takes all kinds to gorge a gyros, doesn't it? Jamie W. and I decided to order our food to go, though he ended up going on a scavenger hunt for a couple of Diet Cokes since Souvla refuses to sell them. He decided to try the Superior Farms Lamb Leg in a Salad ($14), the priciest option on the menu, with chunks of lamb marinated in harissa-spiked yogurt and mixed with cucumber, radish, pickled red onion and feta cheese (photo: bit.ly/1ve0YsT).\n\nIt was pretty good since they mixed in kale with the lettuce, but it needed a bit more kick. Since we already secured our bench on Patricia's Green, it was too bad nobody told us to stock up on hot sauce. Mine was marginally disappointing, the $11 American Homestead Pork Shoulder in a Wrap. The fancy meat was rather sparse compared to the breadiness of the pita almost to the point that it tasted near-vegetarian with cherry tomato, cucumber, pickled red onion and feta cheese. The sweetness of the minted Greek yogurt wasn't helping matters much either (photo:  bit.ly/1y4XdXA). Honestly, the $4 side of Greek Fries was the most satisfying part of my meal as they were doused with lemon juice, olive oil, and mizitrha cheese (photo: bit.ly/1zfasmS). Perhaps I'll go back for take two when it's slow...whenever that is.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...upscale Greek fast food priced for Hayes Valley with the salad more satisfying than the wrap\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...too crowded to notice really\nSERVICE - 2 stars...chaos control needed\nTOTAL - 3 stars...kinda like a Spice Kit for the ooom-pah crowd",

The location is great as it's located along Hayes Valley, and so there's plenty of other options of food and shopping as well. And if Souvla is crowded, there's an outdoor hangout area in Hayes where you can take your food..hopefully with good weather :) If you're looking for a fine-fast Greek restaurant, this is your place! The Hayes Valley location is always pretty crowded, but this Sunday we went wasn't too bad. \n\nI usually order the chicken or lamb salad, but decided to try the vegetarian salad this time around as I wasn't in a meaty mood that day. The vegetarian salad was really good! It comes with roasted sweet potato, garlic yogurt, chopped kalamata olives, toasted walnuts, pickled red onions, pea shoots, and mizithra cheese. The seasoning was fanastic as usual.. And if you're not a salad person, you can have it sandwich style. I would also suggest ordering their greek fries which is seasoned with olive oil, lemon juice, parsley, and mizithra cheese. Their fries are delicious, seasoned so well, and also goes really well with sprinking the fries on the salad ;D",

      "text": "We tried Souvla last night and had two excellent bowls of salad and meat. We'll definitely return the next time we come to that part of San Francisco.\n\nWe knew Souvla was an informal place where you order your food at the counter and then find a place to sit, but we were a little surprised at how long the line was. Still, we figured it must move quickly for all these veterans to be willing to wait, and it did. While in line, we received helpful advice about what and how to order (e.g. order the frozen Greek yogurt when you order your meal, and you'll get a ticket to pick it up when you're ready).\n\nThe main menu is limited: four protein options (one vegetarian) with matched toppings and the choice of a wrap or a salad. We opted for the lamb salad and the braised pork salad. Both salads were big and delicious. I slightly preferred the pork meat, but both were excellent. A tip that's not on the menu: if you want a layer of fries on top of your salad, order it \"Greek Style.\" (If you want more fries, you can order a side of them.)\n\nSouvla gets four stars from me instead of five only because of the limited seating, both indoors and outdoors. Had there been any open space inside, we would have chosen that, but there wasn't. Even for the outdoor seating, we had to circulate and pounce when a table opened up.",

We came around dinner time and it was still rapid\n- Parking might be a little difficult seeing that Hayes street is dine central! \n- I wish I got the worker's name, but he was amazingly awesome! He gave my friend and I suggestions on what to get and got the food experts to cut it in half for us! He was super friendly and accommodating.\n- Greek fries, or yet any fries, but these fries were addicting-ly yums (Yeah, I know that's not a word)\n- Friend and I wanted to get pork and lamb, but didn't know which one we wanted. We decided to do the lamb salad and the pork sandwich. This was the best choice to get the best of both worlds. \n- They are known for their frozen Greek yogurt with baklava crumbles and syrup. And olive oil and flaky sea salt, wildflower honey, sour cherry, and other flavors are other options. I didn't get it since I don't like how sticky the baklava gets stuck on my teeth, but friend got it and it was really good - and for the most part, what people wait for as dessert for their meal! Suggestion is to order it while you're already in line or you'll have to go back in line. Hahaha, obvious, but it'll melt fast.  \n- Friend saved half of her wrap for later because they are huge, but ended up eating it right when she got home. \n- I would come back for the wrap/sandwich! Can't wait!",

      "text": "One of my favorite Greek places to get my lamb wrap! Everything from the atmosphere, decor, service & food is perfecto. Located in the cutest area in Hayes Valley. Totally recommended to go to this area for a date night *wink wink* or a nice dinner night with a group of friends! \n\nMy favorite thing to get here is the Superior Farms Lamb Leg Wrap which consists of Harissa spiked yogurt, cucumber, radish, feta, and pickled red onions. Doesn't that sound amazing? It tastes as good as it sounds! The lamb meat is made to perfection with tenderness & juiciness. Nothing about it was overwhelming and it was very flavorful. This itself is $13 which is a bit pricey but I felt like it definitely was worth it. My tummy was happy. \n\nI've also tried the Greek fries ($4) which was crunchy but not something I would get regularly. It was well seasoned with olive oil, lemon juice, and cheese! Everything with cheese is good to me. For an extra $0.50, you can add this deliciousness inside your wrap! \n\nThe frozen Greek yogurt ($5) is one of the most popular items here! I got mine with honey with baklava crumbles it was so good! It has a tart & creaminess to it which makes it well worth! \n\nOverall, great food & ambiance. Only docked a star off for the wraps being on the pricier side. Definitely one of my favorite places to go to in the area. \n\nTip: try the hot sauce with everything! What doesn't taste good with a little spice?",

      "text": "What a cute, trendy, and tasty Greek gem in Hayes Valley!  \n\nDon't be fooled by the small menu (mainly consists of wraps or salads, froyo, and drinks)- these dishes pack a lot of flavors.  \n\nThe chicken salad option (with granch dressing, fennel, pickled red onion, pea shoots, and mizithra cheese) was very tasty- there was a good balance between the amount of chicken and greens.  Granch dressing was a bit rich for me, but the salad was very filling and satisfying.  We've also ordered the fries on the side- very flavorful (especially with the cheese sprinkled on top) and we were looking at the bottom of the cone getting the scraps by the end; it was that good.  My friend had ordered the lamb bowl, which was also tasty though the lamb was a bit chewy.\n\nIf you can only get one thing from Souvla, it is the baklava frozen yogurt-  this is one of the best froyos I've had in the city so far.  Love the contrast of the tart froyo with the super sweet baklava and honey topping- the baklava is rather sweet on its own.  My friend and I shared this after our salads- it might be a bit much to each alone after a meal.\n\nFYI, being a smaller restaurant, most likely you will have to wait for a table and there will be times where you might have to share your table with someone else.  Service otherwise was super quick, in fact so quick that our food was prepared before we got a table!  Luckily, they held on to it and gave us a hot fresh batch of fries when we were finally able to sit down (we waited 10 min on a Thursday night at 8pm).  \n\nIf you are looking for a quick, trendy, Greek place to eat, I highly recommend trying out Souvla!",

The prices are a little high for a casual restaurant but well worth it for the good quality meats. The decoration inside is cute and the service is really nice.\n\nI got the lamb salad ($14) since the lamb here is my favorite meat but the chicken is really great too! The salad is served in a huge bowl with cucumber, radish, onion, and cheese. I didn't even finish it because they gave so much. \n\nWe also got a side of the juicy potatoes ($4) which has this amazing soft texture because it's been soaked in rotisserie drippings. The frozen greek yogurt here is addicting! Perfectly creamy and not too heavy. I got the baklava crumbles and honey syrup ($5) which was very sweet so wouldn't recommend this if you don't want something overly rich.\n\nOverall this is one of my favorite places to have for lunch or dinner! Definitely try the lamb and frozen yogurt!",

But anyway, it tastes divine, exactly as you (or actually I) can imagine-- thick and tart frozen Greek yogurt. Higher in protein, so it must be good for you? Yeah, exactly! Now, it can be enjoyed alone but why not add the bells and whistles? Don't bother asking if you want the baklava crumbles because duh, yes you want the good stuff. Keep in mind, it's sweeet.\n\nI was wrong in ordering the chicken sandwich the first time as all I can remember was waiting in a long ass line and being disappointed by a mediocre tasting wrap, that was also falling apart, a sad wrap really. Free range in this case meant too healthy and a bit tasteless. So lesson learned, note to self, stick with the yogurt and you won't be disappointed.",

It may have a Greek name, it's not Greek.  \n\nHaving just holidayed in the Greek isles, I wanted a redo.  I was thoroughly seduced by the beauty of Santorini and the beaches of Mykonos, not to mention the millions of great meals I had day in and day out, I read somewhere this is a phenomenal Greek place and rushed over. \n\nIt is not. it's San Francisco Greek, just like Dosa is San Francisco Indian and not real Southern Indian food. A real Southern Indian place ought to have upma, and a real Souvlaki ought to have the right type of texture with the best crunchy cucumbers. I have lost counts on how man souvlakies I had after drinking and partying all day (while on holiday, not on a regular basis), I can assure you this is not it. But.. San Francisco Greek is quite good, and in some cases, perhaps better, certainly healthier, tastier and more innovative. A real Greek salad will not be caught dead with lettuce. I learned that on my trip with my Greek friends. Their salad is super delicious but it has more than the usual Greek ingredients. The lamb souvlaki is way more tenderer than what I had gotten in Greece. \n\nThe ambience though, reminds me of the trendier bars you'd see in Athens late at night. \n\nA winner. But like many great world cuisines, once it's in San Francisco, it takes on a new life, a face lift, and in the process, an ancient cuisine is reinvented to feed (and to fit) the tech workers of a city in transition.",

Can't say much for service since it's paid at order and just a quick hand of your food once ready...

If you're in the neighborhood and looking for a quick dinner, then this is the place! \n\nI met a friend for dinner last night, and I arrived a bit early so I had a glass of rosè. Their house rosè was good, not the best, but still good. It comes with a wine glass and a copper mug, and for about $10 a glass, you certainly get what you pay for in terms of quantity! I had about two full glasses with a single purchase, and it made waiting for my friend all the more bearable. \n\nThis restaurant is self-seating & self-ordering, so I waited in line and snagged a table outside as soon as I could. One of my qualms about this restaurant is that there aren't enough tables. I'd say the restaurant could seat about 40 people comfortably, and after that it would get very cramped. I was lucky enough to get a table when I did, otherwise I dunno what I would've done! \n\nWhen my friend came she and I took turns to stand in line and order, for fear of losing our table. She had the vegetarian salad and I had the pork sandwich with a side of fries that came with garlic yogurt. We dug into our food, and finished most of it. I wasn't too impressed with my sandwich. My friend said her salad was fine, but I think it's hard to judge a restaurants quality of food simply by their salads. The fries along with the garlic yogurt sauce were amazing! We both finished the order, and raved about it afterwards. The fries were slightly greasy and crunchy and hot, and paired with the sauce it was soooo good. \n\nTo sum up, if you're in the neighborhood give this place a try. It's alright, I've had better Greek food over at Bursa in West Portal-best sandwiches ever. However, this place is still good and has a nice vibe. Staff were very nice and accommodating, and the long lines were always nice to see. Takeout seems to be the better option here, as the majority of people I saw in the restaurant would come in and leave with their bags of food. I don't think I'll be back, but it's nice to have in the back of my mind in case I want something different while in that area.",

They move quickly here. \n\nThe inside is small, but tidy. It gets a bit loud - probably from people raving about their delicious food. On warm days the outside seating is really nice. It's in front of the store, but still feels welcoming & feels like it shares space with the pizza joint next door.",

      "text": "I love this place. I've been on multiple occassions - on a weekday for lunch, on a weekend for dinner, just dessert - through busy crowds and less busy times, and this place is consistently delicious and filling. \n\nThings I've tried before:\nMAINS:\n- Pork salad ($12) - The pork salad has your traditional greek flavors- the tomato, onion, and feta are rich and flavorful - making this a hearty salad guaranteed to fill you up. 5/5\n- Chicken salad ($13)- The chicken salad is a little bit lighter flavor wise- probably because the dressing and cheese are less intense and the citrus helps cut some of the richness- but still filling for sure! 5/5\n- Lamb salad- I don't even like lamb much, but I've tried it before, and the meat is good quality.\n\nHave yet to try a sandwich here, but heard that they are really delicious and filling.Portions are generous here, and they do not skimp on the meat- the $ you're paying is worth it. Getting it in a to-go box is a good move though salads can get kind of soggy after so don't wait too long to finish it later. \n\n--\nDESSERT: I LOVE THEIR FROYO (and it's so reasonably priced!) \n\nOlive oil +salt ($4) - I had it here the first time I came to Souvla, and it's hard for me to order anything else - it's my absolute favorite. It's a sort of savory sweetness- the salt actually brings out the natural sweetness of the oil and yogurt. 5/5 - would recommend you try it once even if you think it sounds weird. \n\nThe baklava one and sour cherry ones are good too - I actually didn't love the baklava as much as I thought I would - overpowers the yogurt itself a little bit in my opinion. Sour cherry is solid, but not super memorable compared to the Olive oil haha.\n\nAlso if you're getting froyo in addition to your dinner, you can ask them to make it on the spot after so your froyo doesn't melt while you are waiting around.",

I think the recurring theme here was not enough flavor - the yogurt dipping sauces for the fries (harissa-spices and granch) tasted like plain Greek yogurt, the veg sandwich mostly consisted of thick slices of unspiced potato. \n\nI really loved the atmosphere of Souvla - they've really nailed the fast casual concept and their ingredients are incredibly fresh. I hope they make some updates to their recipes in the future because I really want to go back and try the frozen Greek yogurt (baklava crumbles and honey, I'm looking at you).",

      "text": "It hurts me to give this place one star because I truly enjoy their food and drinks a lot and I've always recommended it to family and friends--it's in a good area, fantastic food, and I never had an issue with their service...until today.\n\nI was a group of three and first to finish ordering so I looked for a place to comfortable seat our group. There weren't any four-tops available--not a problem as this happens at a lot of places in SF. The communal table had space so I had a seat. By the time our third person finished ordering a four-top opened up and she invited us to move. I grabbed our numbers first since they were the closest thing in my reach and put them on the new table. But then a female customer that was STILL IN LINE steps up to us and said that was her table when there was no evidence it had been saved. Not a purse. Not a coat. No number. NOTHING to indicate it had been taken and I already put our number stands down. \n\nWe didn't want to argue so we let it go and were going back to our spots at the communal table. It wasn't that big of a deal. Sure we were a little miffed that someone could act that way, but you have to pick your battles. Mind you, I've been to Souvla a dozen times and I get how their process works. Order first, sit after. Not everyone abides by that but I always do. That's the fair and right way to do things. \n\nBut then as we were moving back, the cashier (With a very distinct hairstyle. Not to name names.) purposely came over to the communal table to reprimand us in front of everyone at the restaurant. She antagonized us saying that if we were going to sit at the communal table we have to keep our numbers with us and we can't keep them at a separate table. She was completely did not even know the truth of the situation and judged us for what happened, then blasted us in front of all the other diners, especially the other diners at the communal table. Talk about awkward!!! I had to correct her and tell her that we were trying to move tables; it honestly wasn't even an issue as it was solved between us and the other customer.\n\nExcept now some small incident that should've been harmless between some diners has completely soured my experience at the establishment. I felt insulted and looked down upon by the employee and preemptively judged by our race and assuming we were trying to cause problems with the operation when it was sincerely not the case. She didn't even apologize for the miscommunication. During the rest of our meal I felt SO UNCOMFORTABLE around the other communal table diners and the atmosphere was incredibly uninviting. \n\nAt first I thought I was just sensitive to the situation, but talking to my friends afterward, they also felt the same uncomfortable hostility. I work at a 5-star hotel--I know when service is poor and this was it. I definitely regret spending $40 of my hard earned money there and I feel even more sorry to my friend who had never been to Souvla and was excited to try it on her first visit to SF because of my recommendation. I regrettably won't be back and I certainly won't be recommending this place to anyone anymore.\n\nEDIT: Looking at the other reviews I see that another Asian customer felt antagonized as well. Sad to hear Souvla is racist.",

Souvla is a small shop in the city that has a small menu of pita wraps, salads, soups, and yogurt. They focus on a few items, and perfect them. \n\nThe minute you enter the restaurant, your immediate attention is the rotisserie chicken display in the back. Their chicken is roasted fresh each day continuously throughout the day. Their other meats aren't on display but I would assume it's just the same. I always go for the chicken wrap or salad which are both filling. The chicken salad is a dollar more but has more meat and lies on a big bed of kale salad. \n\nThe main attraction though has to be the baklava frozen yogurt. The yogurt comes with a huge amount of baklava on perfectly tart Greek yogurt ice cream. The mixture between the two is perfect with the overall dessert the perfect amount of sweetness. \n\nOverall, Souvla is an amazing place for lunch or dinner even though it's always so packed. \n\nTips - get your wraps and yogurt to go and seat in the benches in the park to eat.",

The first flavor profile resembles that of a breakfast burrito; the egg, lamb, tomato, and onion taste savory balanced by a touch of tartness and acidity. The garlic yogurt, lamb, tomato, and onion taste like a normal pita. Different bites of the sandwich gave different ratios of those profiles, which I enjoyed.\n\nI also ordered fries w/harissa spiked yogurt.

It reminds me of the Greek version of Spinnerie, also one of my go-to dinner spots. You order before seating yourself - there's plenty of seating that's first come, first serve. There's a large communal table as well as a lot of bar seating inside. There's both indoor and outdoor seating. Entrees will run you between $10-$14 and sides are $4-$6. Pricing depends on the meat you choose( lamb, pork, chicken, veg) and whether you choose a sandwich (gyro) or salad. \n\nI had the chicken kale salad, which was delicious. Fresh rotisserie style chicken, great mix of lacinato kale and greens, grated cheese, greek dressing and onions. Huge portions. I also ordered a lemon chicken rice soup which was delicious, but definitely not necessary given how large the salad was. \n\nLast but not least, they have an amazing Greek frozen yogurt with different toppings. I tried the cinnamon crumble today but will definitely be back to try the sour cherry!",

      "text": "The Greek Frozen Yogurt was addicting and amazing! As someone who is a hardcore greek yogurt fan (literally I eat it everyday), greek yogurt in froyo form? What could be better?!...well the toppings on it. I got the one with Bakalava Crumbles & Honey syrup, and it was a great $5 that I have no regrets at all of spending. The greek froyo part itself, is plain, but delicious as is already. The frozen yogurt is tart and creamy and literally tastes like my favorite type of thick, creamy, Greek yogurt (think of brands like Fage, Siggi's, etc). The baklava oozed of cinnamon, pistachios, and honey and went perfectly with the slightly tart yogurt. They have other flavors such as Olive oil & flaky sea salt, Cherry, etc. \n\nSouvla also has salads, sandwiches, fries, drinks, and other goodies. If I hadn't already eaten when I came I would've definitely dined here! I definitely am planning to come back again soon!",

I heard that someone cancelled their order and a different staff member was swearing right in front of the register, which was a little uncomfortable. I'm not sure if that event effected the mood the cashier, but that's not my problem. The cashier didn't seem like she wanted to answer my questions about the menu, and I felt like I was rushed through the ordering process. I get that it's busy, but it's not like I'm ordering fast food and the amount that I'm paying is (or should have been) reflective of that. The cashier starts unnecessarily explaining to my friends and I that our numbers have to be at the table we're sitting at (even though we were all still standing and haven't settled down yet). Definitely felt like she was acting like we didn't understand simple seating or dining etiquette  (maybe because we're Asian), which is pretty insulting. Don't think I will be coming back, there are other Mediterranean options that have better service.",

Their menu is simple, yet I always have a hard time choosing what to order because everything is so yummy. Prices are relatively cheap too, especially for SF. \n\nI usually switch between the Pork Shoulder and Mary's Free-Range Chicken. I've found that the pork shoulder pairs better with the pita and the chicken as a salad, but both are delicious either way. The pork shoulder is saltier and fattier, so if you're looking for a healthier option, I'd go with the chicken. \n\nIf you're in the mood for something sweet after, I highly recommend their Baklava & Honey frozen greek yogurt. The tartness of the yogurt goes perfectly with the sugar from the baklava and honey. A must try!",

I got into froyo toward the end of college and when I moved away I continued to get froyo a couple times a week. I had a seperate budget just for froyo. Ish was real....Then one day I realized that all the froyo (even the original tart) was not the same. It could never be as good as the greek froyo at Berry Berry. I stopped getting froyo and turned to boba to fill the void in my heart (read: stomach). \n\nAfter discovering Souvla I've found love again. Best Greek froyo hands-down! The froyo here blew my mind. I never though that olive oil would go well with sweets! And sea salt?? What's up with that? But, it was recommended, so I had to put my reluctance to the side. I tried the first spoon. AMAZING!! The olive oil was so fresh and the sea salt added a little munch that was much needed. Wowowowow, I will never leave froyo again. The void has now been filled! Thanks, Souvla!\n\nOh, also the food was scruptious too. You can't go wrong with anything you order at this place! Highly recommended!",

I hate this place!!!\n\nShould you choose to \"dine in\" there's an excellent hot sauce on the table, free to shake over your food as you'd like (the food absolutely needs the seasoning). But if you decide the cramped and stressful dining atmosphere is not for you, you must ask (and PAY FOR) a shitty ramekin to go. So yes, you can enjoy your inconsistent, overpriced sandwich in the comfort of your own home, but you must pay even more money to remove yourself from the hellish landscape of dining in. Oh and often there's bone and cartilage in the meat. I hate this place! Let's collectively stop going here",

They have a vegetarian option too! \n\nWe ordered a chicken sandwich and a lamb salad, with a side of fries. Both proteins were great, but I LOVED the lamb. It was so tender and flavorful, and looking at the dripping meat in the rotisserie in the back of the restaurant, I can see why. I even liked the salad alone a lot more than I thought I would. It was well dressed with kale, romaine, fennel, pickled onions, and feta cheese, and it didn't taste plain or boring at all. The pita for the sandwich was soft and a good size, and the fries were perfectly crispy and seasoned.\n\nI ended up coming back a few days later to try the frozen greek yogurt with baklava crumbles and honey, and my boyfriend and I both loved it! I was a little worried that it would be overwhelmingly sweet especially with the addition of the baklava and honey, but it was perfect. The frozen Greek yogurt itself was tart and tangy/cheesy (not very sweet at all, which I liked), and it went perfectly with the baklava crumbles (I don't taste much of the honey).\n\nWhat a Hayes Valley gem.

I usually get the yogurt and oil dressing on the side and use only the yogurt dressing but the salad doesn't really need it in my opinion.  The salad is very flavorful all on its own.  \n\nWould definitely recommend.",

The flavors are so fresh and the radish and cheese accompany the meat beautifully. We finished our meal with the Baklava Greek yogurt and it is my FAVORITE. I came back the next day to get another one!!! Absolute must try.",

All locations serve the same dishes and the quality is consistent throughout all their locations.\n\nI highly recommend:\n\n- Mary's free-range chicken salad ($13) = fresh fennel, pea shoots, navel orange, pickled onions\n\n- Great salad to share or eat it as a lunch meal;\n\n- Lamb Sandwich ($10) = I like gyro and this was satisfying and filling;\n\n- Frozen Greek Yogurt w/ Baklava = drizzle with honey was quite a happy ending to my meal.\n\nSouvla is equally busy during lunch and dinner and sometimes you may encounter a short line. It's DEFINITELY worth the wait!",

      "text": "I really like the idea of this place. Quick and easy. Sometimes I just want a fast but tasty meal. I don't need eating to be a whole affair all the time. After a couple hours at the MOMA, the bestie and I came here for a delicious but light lunch as we were going to get boba afterwards. We got a chicken salad to share which they split for us! How nice. They gave a good amount of toppings so it didn't feel like it was just salad. I noticed how some reviews said the dressing was too heavy or how the salad is bland. I thought it was really tasty and yes they do drench on the dressing but just ask for it on the side. \n\nWe got a greek yogurt and it was freaking delicious. What I liked was that they gave us the receipt and had us pick up the yogurt after we ate our salad so the yogurt wouldn't melt.  I went through a fro-yo crave and generally got the regular fro-yo. This greek yogurt gave all those pink berry and pink berry wannabes a run for their money. We got the honey one which I would suggest you avoid as the honey doesn't go well with a cold item. The seating can be a bit tight but I feel like if you wait a bit something will free up.",

      "text": "This place is fantastic, I would eat here every week if I could and it's one of the better places to eat in Hayes Valley.\n\nYou basically pick your choice of protein (chicken, lamb, pork, or roasted sweet potato) and get it as a wrap or a salad - it's a slightly small menu but it's relatively healthy and the options are all good, so you can't really go wrong. The salads are a bit on the pricey side, and it's usually around $14 for the chicken, but for the quality and quantity of salad, I find it's worth it. \n\nThe Mary's Free Range chicken salad is one of my top 3 salads in San Francisco (up there with the Plant Organic kale salad and the OMG Omega salad from Sweetgreen). It has their \"Granch\" dressing which is made with Greek yogurt, fennel. pickled red onion, and cheese over a mix of kale & romaine. The chicken is fresh rotisserie chicken so no cold, bland chicken here. The whole salad comes together wonderfully with a lot of textures and flavor and they are pretty generous with the chicken. I normally ask for dressing on the side since a lot of salads tend to be overdressed, but I don't normally find the salads here overdressed.\n\nThe frozen Green Yogurt froyo is also amazing - it's tangy and sweet at the same time and pairs perfect with the toppings. My favorite topping is the baklava crumble and honey syrup. It's worth the $4-5 splurge for this treat.\n\nThe lines around peak lunch and dinner hours can be quite long, and there isn't a ton of seating inside, so be prepared to wait and to also take your food outside to Patricia's Green to eat. You'll have to exercise patience to get your food and maybe a table, but it's worth it for the salads. I always crave salads from this place - it's one of my favorites!",

      "text": "Amazing food but the service is going downhill so much that it's a dealbreaker. \n\nSouvla is one of a growing breed of restaurants that's trying to tackle the difficulty of hiring for the service industry (due to the high living costs in SF) by having an order at the counter and self service concept. They have runners but no servers. \n\nThey'll bring your food out to you but you'll figure out things like water on your own. \n\nWhich should make it great for delivery and I must go here at least a couple of times a week. \n\nThe food is always really fresh and high quality. I love the chicken salad. The portion sizes always seem to vary a little bit, more meat in the evenings, but I love the speed of take out. \n\nMost recent experience was just rudeness. I normally check if my order is ready before I get the notification on my phone because they sometimes take a while to put it into Square. The woman looked at me when I asked if my order was ready and said you ordered 4 minutes ago like cmon. Definitely true but Souvla has been known to get orders ready in minutes during peak periods and hey, it was just a question.  \n\nWaited a while longer and my order came out but they didn't record it in square and there was no one handling deliveries so I looked over to see if that order was mine or if I should walk around and come back, the guy manning the counter came over immediately and gave me a hard time saying dude you don't do that. What? Order here every week, expecting to pick up my order while it's still fresh? Or hope that the fact it's actually ready will be recorded in Square properly so I don't have to check at the counter when I come in if it is. \n\nSouvla I love your 5 star food but your 0 star service means it's not going to work out.

It's definitely worth to try it out, but for the amount of waiting during peak and non-peak hours for the price point, it may not be worth it for some people. I've enjoyed it but do see it being no more special than some of the other hole-in-the-walls I've been to for authentic Mediterranean. Still though, delicious food, just wish it wasn't so packed because it can seem a bit overhyped for the Souvla virgin",

      "text": "First time review, been many times. \n~Food~  \nChicken Salad: Chicken was moist and flavorful. You can tell they put thought into the salad itself because it has such a great combo of ingredients including mandarin oranges, sprouts, crumbly cheese. You're not just tasting chicken and leafs. It's a whole flavor dance on your tongue. \nFries: Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. Even cuts (aka no over-fried tiny pieces at the bottom of the cup) and didn't even need a dipping sauce. \nWildflower Honey Greek Froyo: If you like tangy and tart true-froyo like me, this is your jam. There are not many places that do true froyo with the yogurt taste anymore and I will come here just for this. The honey adds a touch of sweetness and doesn't distract too much from the tart flavor. \nBaklava Greek Froyo: Similar to the honey one but with added texture of the bakalva (which is like honey soaked granola) If you like your froyo with more texture, flavor, sweetness, this is your cup. \n\n~Price/Quality/Quantity~  \n$14 Chicken Salad: If you're going to get the salad with sides/desserts, definitely share or you won't have room after the salad! A good tasting and filing portion.\n$5 Fries: Don't let the small cup fool you, there are a lot of fries for one order.\n$5 Greek Froyo: Tasty and worth it. \n\n~Atmosphere/Service~\nThere's not a lot of seating but the space is bright and airy. People tend to filter through the seating pretty quickly. If weather permits, I recommend sitting on the green right across street. The staff was amazing and very accommodating. If you order froyo, they'll bring it to you after your food.\nDon't get scared by the line, it moves relatively quickly.",

It can get pretty busy around peak times and I've had to stand up for a little after ordering my food, but I've always found a spot before my food arrives. They have a pretty simple menu where you choose a protein (there's a vegetarian option too), and then decide if you it in a salad or wrap, which each comes with unique ingredients that combined are phenomenal. They also offer sides like fries with various dipping sauces, and Greek frozen yogurt. The frozen yogurt is worth a trip here alone. They have some unusual but delicious toppings like olive oil and sea salt, but my personal favorite is the baklava!",

Flavors were light and bright, much like being on the beach on the Mediterranean. \n\nWe tried the chicken salad, potatoes and chicken sandwich. The chicken is tender and seasoned just enough. The salad also included kale, romaine, shaved fennel, sliced oranges and pickled onions. The colors were beautiful and every ingredient had a purpose and made sense. The balance was perfect.\n\nThe sandwich was pretty much the salad inside of a piece of pita bread. Can't go wrong, especially with a fluffy cloud wrapped around your sandwich! \n\nThe winning dish: the juicy potatoes. Considering the potatoes are dressed in chicken drippings, the flavors are surprisingly light and bright. Absolutely delicious. \n\nFinished off with the cherry frozen Greek yogurt. I won't even talk about it, just get it. \n\nGreat sunlight. Nice amount of seating. And a bevy of cute young people to look at. My kind of place.\n\nWill definitely be coming back to try other proteins. And the French fries are calling my name!",

      "text": "Souvla makes the best salad I've ever reluctantly put into my mouth.\n\nProbably because it's covered in a generous amount of yummy roasted lamb bits and yogurt sauce.\n\nIf you're in the area, Souvla's a great option if you feel like grabbing a healthy (or at least healthy-feeling) soup, salad, or sandwich.  Not anything super revolutionary, but fresh solid Mediterranean flavors.  I had the lamb, but the chicken fire-roasting in the back looked very tempting.  Each choice of protein comes with its own combination of salad toppings, but they'll switch out the proteins at your request.\n\nFrozen yogurt is also really good and relatively guilt free (again, can't speak for it actually being healthy, but \"yogurt\" sounds good for you right?).  The baklava topping was a bit pasty for my taste, I was expecting some of the flakiness of the puff pastry to be preserved.  Will try the olive oil and sea salt next time.\n\nTips and Tricks\n-If you eat outside, be prepared for random people coming up to you asking what you're eating or if it's good.  Real live yelp reviews required\n-Always get dessert!\n-Actually gets really packed at dinner after 6",

I got salads for takeout today and not only the cashier was rude to me and rolled his eyes at me multiple times and started talking to the next customer in line when i was not even done he did not asked whether I want my dressing on the salad or on side and when I got home the salad was dry. Honestly the salads here are good for dressing but who wants to pay 13 dollars for a dry salad? I had bought two too. \nsecond complain: the lady who was preparing my froyos asked me something and since the restaurant was so loud I did not her therefore I just guessed and said what toppings I want and she just yelled at me \"do you want lids?\"\nit wasn't a pleasant experience tbh. I don't understand why they were not nice.",

I almost always get the frozen greek yogurt--I usually ask for it plain because I personally prefer to enjoy the subtly tanginess, creaminess, and lightness of the yogurt without any of the toppings.

      "text": "I had been meaning to try Souvla for a while, as I am a big fan of greek food. Since I was in the area and in need of lunch, I decided today was the day that I give it a try.\n\nThe location here is great, just a few shops down from Patricia's Green and situated among a number of other great restaurants, shops and dessert places. The presentation is great as well, everything from the trendy menu to the plating of the items served to you.\n\nI have a few problems with Souvla though. For one, if I am going to be paying $12 for lamb at a place where you order at the counter, I expect to be getting a good amount of meat. As evidenced by my pictures, this is definitely not the case. This is further troubling as it is obviously intentionally hidden by placing a pile of radish and cucumber on top of everything else. \n\nSecondly, there are basically three options on the entire menu for entrees. You basically get to choose from chicken, lamb or pork and that's it. If you are going to so drastically limit my options, I am going to place a much higher level of expectation on the quality than normal. Although the food was maybe slightly above average, these higher expectations were not met.\n\nLastly, I was rather disappointed with the greek yogurt with baklava crumbles on it. Quite frankly there were no crumbles. As this item was prepared before me, I saw the server literally pour frozen yogurt in a cup and then attempt to smash a piece of baklava on top against the side of the cup. This is simply unacceptable. It would be trivial to actually have crumbled baklava ready to at the very least sprinkle on top, or even better, actually mix it in to the yogurt like the professionals over at loving cup do.\n\nI doubt I will be inclined to give this place a second chance. I think Souvla needs to spend less effort trying to be trendy and more effort into increasing both the quality and quantity of their food.",

This place definitely gets points for their hours, as finding a place to eat in SF after 9 P.M. is very challenging.\n\nI like that the menu is super simple. You choose your ideal meat and you choose whether you want a salad or sandwich. There are a few other menu choices and some sides; however, it's very simple over all.\n\nI ordered the pork sandwich and a side of fries. I have no regrets about the sandwich, even after bringing it home and eating it 15 minutes later.\n\nThe pork sandwich (basically a pork gyro) was flavorful, juicy, and well seasoned with all the right trimmings and the bread that held it together was hearty and tasted fresh.\n\nThe fries I would probably go without next time. They were fresh and hot but lacked the crunch I like. The parmesan cheese and parsley sprinkled on top was a nice touch but I wish the cheese would've melted on the fries.",

The cucumber and feta cheese was a great flavor combination but I thought the lamb was kinda dry. I actually wished the lamb was in stripes rather than chunks of meat? It was kinda hard to eat. Regardless the sandwich was flavorful and satisfying\n\nBaklava yogurt- refreshing! I'm not a frozen yogurt fan but I can tell why everyone likes it! Great happy ending to the meal :)\n\nOverall, friendly and quick service with great food makes me want to come back again! Especially for the fries and I want to try the salads!\n\nYummy!",

The perfect amount of tart, sweet, and crunch.

Thick cut fries with the right amount of seasoning and salt. \n\nImprovements\n- Chicken salad: I ordered with pita on the side, thanks yelper for the recommendation. Ingredients were fresh, but everything tasted oily and bland. The garlic yogurt dip for my fries made this salad a lot more tastier. \n- Seating was limited during dinner time on the Saturday evening that I came. Consider take out if you are pressed for time and don't want to wait for a seat. \n- The cashier was not friendly nor helpful when I asked for recommendations and the other employee that brought my to go order out to me totally redeemed everything by simply saying a \"Thank you and have a nice evening.\"\n\nTip\n- Don't even try to drive here on a weekend evening especially when there are also events going on around the vicinity. Parking is ridiculous especially during peak dinner hours. Uber, Lyft, Sidecar, carpool, etc...you get the deal, trust me!",

It's just not a thing here in SF but happy to see it here!!. There are a few places that have filled that need but this place, it's overpriced for what you get. The best thing is the pitta bread, and that's it, in my opinion.  Nevertheless, we ordered this evening through Caviar (the delivery service that they use). The food turned up on time at 720 PM  YAY !!  Unfortunately, we were missing an item. I called Souvla at 730 PM and that's where the shit the fan for me.  I found out that you cant talk to a person real-time. I was forced to leave a VOICE MAIL MESSAGE: really, IT'S A RESTAURANT!!!   \n\nPablo from the Hayes Valley site eventually called me back at 930PM, 2 HOURS LATER!! THIS IS PITIFUL!!  YOU ARE IN THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS!!   Who wants a response about their food this late? Pablo appeared to be a be nice guy but who directly blamed the lack of the missing item on Caviar and suggested I call them.  As I said on the phone NO SIR, IF YOU FILL THE BAG THEN THEY WILL DELIVER IT,  YOU CANNOT BLAME THE LACK OF AN ITEM ON THE DELIVERY SERVICE. I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO THAT POINT OUT! Request for supervisor contact information not fulfilled; therefore Souvla sucks!",

(Note: they're supposedly opening one in the Alamo square park area on divisadero sometime this year!)\n\nI've had the pork salad two times and have enjoyed it both times--it is very flavorful with a nice sweet component from the pork and a saltiness from the cheese. It also feels like you get quite a bit for your money, as the portion is pretty big. Haven't had the froyo yet but hope to try it sometimes.\n\nThere isn't much seating, so be ready to prowl for a seat or take it to go. I've been lucky enough to get a seat both inside and outside (very limited outdoor seating). The line ideas usually pretty long, but service is pretty fast. Great option if your in the area and looking for a fresh meal.",

      "text": "I tried Souvla for my first time last summer and was not very impressed with the food. I got the lamb sandwich and dined-in. The lamb from the sandwich wasn't for me - I don't know if they were having an off day, as the lamb is quite frequently raved about, but for me it was dry and almost too gamey for me to enjoy. I gave leftovers to a friend.\n\nHowever, I recently ordered Souvla via Caviar for dinner because I was craving a salad. I can't tell you how many times I've walked by and seen people devouring such yummy looking salads, so I figured I'd give it another shot. I'm really glad I did. \n\nI ordered the chicken salad in addition to a cup of the frozen yogurt drizzled with sour cherry topping (had trouble deciding between that and baklava crumble). It was the perfect meal and I ate all of it. Like, every single morsel. \n\nThe salad was super fresh, the pieces of chicken were plentiful and moist, the orange in the salad was such a complementary flavor to the savory chicken and tangy feta. I really enjoyed it. Then, I ate my frozen yogurt, which I had stored in the freezer while I was eating my salad. For me, I know a food is either really good or really bad when I put it in my mouth and squeal. Thank goodness it was the former. The yogurt is so light and the consistency is perfect - soft and creamy without being runny at all. The sour cherry topping is something that I will definitely get again - perfect amount of sweetness and tartness when paired with the yogurt. \n\nNow I crave this meal on the regular. Will be back soon. Thank you, Souvla!",

There was a huge line when we arrived, but it moved fast and our food arrived even faster! \n\nMy friends and I shared a bottle of rosé (so awesome that they serve wine by the way)! We also shared a side of fries which were perfectly salty and crunchy!\n\nI got the sandwich with chicken. It was so big that I couldn't finish it all but WOW it was tasty and you could tell all of the ingredients are fresh. The chicken was tender and shredded. With their \"Granch\" dressing which was creamy and delicious. As well as navel orange, red onion, and pea shoots. They place their hot sauce on all of their tables which I put on my sandwich and it escalated the taste! Their hot sauce is so so good! I put it on every bite!\n\nLast, you must try their frozen greek yogurt! It's tangy and creamy the perfect dessert if you love greek yogurt. I topped mine with olive oil and sea salt which was addicting! Some people feel weird about the olive oil taste, but the combination is outstanding in my opinion. Highly recommend trying it if you're the type of person that likes to drizzle olive oil on your food.",

Before I moved to Portland, I was dining here once a week. \n\nOrder at the counter, get your number + your bevvy, and grab a seat.\n\nDine-In\nAll locations are clean and modern and open and bright. I absolutely love that vibe when eating this kind of food.\n\nTake-Out\nI've gotten Souvla delivered more times than I can count and every single time it was almost as good as dining in. It's the perfect kind of food you want delivered when you are trying to stay healthy(ish) but you're too lazy to leave the house and you need something filling and delicious. \n\nMenu\nHonestly, there isn't a single item I've had that I didn't love. \n\nMy go-to is the lamb sandwich. I'm not one to get lamb over pork, BUT at Souvla IT ME. All meats are delicious, but their lamb is superior indeed. The sandwich is perfectly-sized to fill my tummy, but I don't feel over-stuffed if I eat the whole thing in one sitting. Impressive portioning IMO.\n\nThe salads are SUBSTANTIAL and I can never finish mine when I go that route, which I appreciate because it's not bad leftover either.\n\nThe greek fries are really just YUM. Add a side of Granch (Greek Ranch) and you will have yourself a perfect little side. \n\nThe wine options are delish, but I usually go for the Greek cherry soda because it's a sugar bomb that I can't resist - like a Greek Jarritos if you will.\n\nThe BEST thing Souvla has to offer is their greek froyo. \n__\nPro Tip: Get the froyo with Baklava crumbs on top AND olive oil + flaky sea salt and don't look back.",

The \"granch\" dressing is basically greek yogurt and ranch, which is as delicious as it sounds. Defeats the purpose of eating a salad if you're gonna drench it though. If you choose to live your life on the edge, by all means, go ham.\n\nLamb Sandwich (13) - Lots of meat so you're definitely getting what you paid for. However, the lamb was a tad dry. I felt like it could've used more yogurt. The cucumber gave it a nice crunch and was refreshing too! \n\nFrozen Greek Yogurt w/ Baklava Crumbles (5) - ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! Not too sweet, even with the syrup. Perfect way to end the meal.\n\nI would make my way over here for the dessert alone. This is an excellent spot for a solid post-gym meal. Will be back!",

There was a line but wait was less than 10 minutes. \n\nI had the rotisserie chicken salad and I have to say, it's one of my favorite salads of all times! I never had fruit in my salad that I actually liked, but this was different. Orange slices paired with chicken created a nice acidity with some sweetness. The salad comprised of kale, pickles, and feta cheese (I think?). Seating was hard to find, so we ate at a nearby park. A little pricey for a salad though. \n\nThe second time I came with 5 other friends. My boyfriend and I tried the pork shoulder wrap and fries with garlic greek yogurt. The pork wrap was meh as it was wrapped in a really dry pita. Even the veggies and sauce couldn't make up for it :P\n\nThe fries on the other hand were marvelous but the star was that garlic dip! It was so rich and creamy it felt like I was heavy cream + sour cream. Dip your hot fries in it and you won't regret it ;) \n\nI sampled the baklava and honey frozen greek yogurt from friends and it was delicious as well! The greek yogurt was different than what I expected as it was tart and mildly salty. The baklava and honey complemented it really well though. \n\nIn summary, the chicken salad, baklava/honey greek yogurt, and the fries WITH garlic yogurt dip is the way to go.",

      "text": "I love this food however I am EXTREMELY disappointed in the woman working at the counter today. She was extremely rude, I ordered an online order. She helped out four different people in the line, no issues. And then I politely say \" excuse me can I please get help\". She goes \"there's a line\". Finally I get my food, and I say thank you she says nothing in return and gives me a nasty look. The point of online orders is to get it quickly. Not to wait for her to check out the whole line serving wine and soft serve which takes a while. She took seven minutes of my lunch break. I would've been better off hopping in line and ordering food. No waitress should be rude to her customers when they are simply waiting for an order that is ready and takes two seconds to pass out. Again the food here is amazing and all the men that work here are fabulous. Extremely disappointed in this woman and her inappropriate behavior.",

      "text": "It is all about the salads. Don't let anyone else tell you otherwise.\n\nAnother tip - the Souvla hot sauce is great. Add fries to your salad also.\n\nNot at all a fan of the wraps. Granted, I had just come back from Greece and was craving Greek food. I came here when they opened in 2014 and  was very disappointed in the wraps. They were dry and bland. I did try the frozen greek yogurt with sea salt which I enjoyed at the time. Since then, I haven't liked the yogurt, maybe because they put too much sea salt. I also found the baklava overwhelmingly sweet.\n\nBack to the salads, they are special. Obviously salads are best fresh, but Souvla salads are one of the few that travel well and is good the next day. I've ordered Souvla through Caviar for work lunches and dinners, because really, there aren't many salad options when you're ordering for dinner. I typically get the chicken or pork salad and add fries. Occasionally, I'll ask for the lamb salad and sub out the lamb for chicken or pork.",

If you're a veg-head order this and thank me later. I got it without cheese/dressing on the side, and it was perfect. If you're vegan or dairy free they automatically give you oil on the side. For everyone else, a dollop of the garlic greek yogurt dressing is delicious. My friend ordered the chicken salad and loved every bite. Keep in mind the salads are big enough to share, so if you order your own you may end up with leftovers. Dessert also looked delicious, but we were too stuffed to try anything.

It was ready so quickly! I got the chicken salad with fries on top, which was an excellent decision. It was like having delicious croutons - they were even good when they got cold and soggy after a while. Generous portion, I didn't even snack the rest of the night and I wasn't hungry when I woke up. \nI did order the $4 iced tea and I didn't like it. Overpriced and too sweet for me. It's bottled so maybe it would be better poured into a glass with ice. \nDefinitely will be returning for the convenience and taste and I'm already worried I'm going to spend too much money here.",

I ordered chicken salad and my husband got lamb salad. To our surprise they were not as good as we expected. The salad size was reasonable with a variety of vegetables. The downside was the dressing. It was too greasy and unhealthy for us. We preferred that the dressing was not mixed and came aside the salad. The chicken was greasy too and didn't taste good.

The food truck area is a very nice area to meet up with friends - wish there were more tables and chairs to accommodate more guests since it is soo popular on the weekend.

We ordered the lamb salad, chicken salad, Greek beer, white wine and yogurt with sea salt and olive oil. I love that you can pay for the yogurt ahead of time and get it after you finish your meal. It was a bit pricey for lunch but after i took a bite of my salad, I understood why. The ingredients are really fresh and they provide a generous portion of salad and the meat. Everything tasted very fresh and overall the meal was filling. I was surprised by the quality of the white wine - it was very fragrant and perfect for a summer day in SF. We were able to snag seats outside and people watch - lots of fun watching all walks of life enjoy Souvla. Lastly, the Greek yogurt is to die for!!! It is the perfect combination of sea salt and olive oil, down to the last bite. Can't wait to come back and try the fries as well as other flavors for the yogurt.",

I would come here all the time.\n\n+ Pork salad: the pork was really good, not dry or flavorless. And they pack in a LOT of meat which is nice; I hate when salads are literally 98% lettuce. My only gripe is that because it was a salad, the yogurt sauce was spread pretty thin. I noticed the sandwiches were packed with so much more flavor. \n+ Lamb sandwich: I really really liked the ingredients that came with the lamb option, and the meat itself was pretty good, if not a bit dry. The real winner was the pita bread that the \"sandwich\" was wrapped in - soooo fluffy, not dry or stale by any means!\n+ Greek fries: really crispy but a bit plain. It doesn't have very much flavor to it.\n\nWish I had gotten to try the frozen Greek yogurt, but I had to save room for Smitten ice cream! The decor is awesome and the space is really pretty, though a tad bit small. I wouldn't recommend bringing larger parties here. The order system was pretty quick, too. I could imagine myself coming here quite often for a fast meal. Too bad it's on the other end of the state..",

      "text": "Excellent and innovative Greek-style cuisine, great service, awesome location and reasonable prices. The chef here, Tony, did eight years as chef de cuisine at Kokkari and it shows.\n\nThe chefs here are talented at being both inventive / experimental and delivering high quality, excellent tasting dishes. For example, multiple rotisserie meats, including lamb, pork and chicken hand encrusted with cheese grinds giving the meats a flavorful boost. We had the chicken and actually ended up taking an additional entire rotisserie chicken home with us. Another example is the Frozen GREEK yogurt - my favorite was the baklava flavor, but the olive oil and salt flavor was yummy and new. The salad was refreshing and well made. \n\nSo, carryout is an option, but I still recommend dining in. The decor is pretty cool. There are both tables and bars to enjoy your meal. It's a small restaurant and popular so seating may be limited. It has a clean / hip vibe. \n\nThe surrounding neighborhood is very cool too and worth walking around just to check out.\n\nI highly recommend Souvla. Looking forward to returning.",

Followed up with the perfectly sweet yogurt & chewy baklava crumbles, my heart and belly were so pleased. Walk it off strolling nearby shops. Great area and I will certainly return to Souvla!!",

The juicy potatoes are crazy good, as is the frozen yogurt - baklava for a classic Greek flavor, olive oil and salt for something slightly different.\n\nYes, this location is on the smaller side and I've often had to wait for a table, but I've never been stranded long and always have been able to find something before my food arrives. \n\nPlus they are on Caviar! Perfect meal for when you have a crazy day and need something yummy delivered.",

      "text": "So I've always wanted to go to Souvla but being a pescatarian there isn't great options here. I finally went with a friend couple nights ago who convinced me the vegetarian option was good too. I ordered the vegetarian salad which was kale, roasted sweet potatoes, pea sprouts, mizithra cheese, kalamata olives. It wasn't bad for a salad, and the sweet potatoes (aka the veg equivalent of a protein) was a generous helping. But for as much as people love Souvla's meat options, I am disappointed that the veg option is pretty basic, nothing special. Especially in a city like SF where vegetarian food standards are so high. Maybe some protein - like chickpeas would be good - it is a Greek spot after all.\nWe also split the Greek frozen yogurt with the baklava topping - really good froyo (not too sour or sweet) and the baklava was decent considering it is Greek ;)",

Brought a friend from LA because I love Souvla and knew she would too. \n\nWe ordered to-go because all the seats were jam packed and couldn't find a spot. After we ordered, spots outside opened up and we sat outside. The employee who came outside gave us our food and glared at us \"didn't you guys take this to go??\" Like he didn't want us eating outside or eating here at all because we ordered to go. I quickly said, \"oh we are going to eat a little and leave.\" Then he doesn't say anything and stormily cleans up the dishes beside us. \n\nI'm bothered by this because we felt uncomfortable and uneasy like we weren't allowed to dine on premise. We would have said \"dining here\" if there had been spots open. We sat for two minutes and left to eat in the park. \n\nI LOVE the food don't get me wrong, but it's Friday and I just wanted to enjoy a day with my friend. His unwelcoming attitude bothered us for the rest of the day.",

      "text": "Whenever someone asks me for a restaurant recommendation  I ALWAYS recommend Souvla. They're salads and sandwiches are delicious and filling. I probably eat Souvla 2-3 times a month. \n\nSouvla is the perfect ambiance for a date (casual yet romantic lighting) or to meet up with friends. The food is beyond delicious and they offer alcohol and amazing frozen greek yogurt.\n\nThe pricing is pretty decent (typical SF pricing) and the food is VERY filling. When looking at the menu, you pick your protein (chicken, lamb, veggie, etc) then you decide if you want it as a salad or sandwich. The sandwich is wrapped in a yummy warm pita bread and the salad serving is large enough to save some for lunch the next day or if you're very hungry it is super filling. \n\nThey pair chicken with yummy fresh oranges and lamb with crips radishes. My favorite is the chicken salad and the lamb sandwich. The chicken is moist and juicy and you can even buy a full chicken when there. There is typically a line outside of the door but it moves quick, the Hayes location is somewhat small and can be hard to find seating but the park is nearby.\n\nI'm also a huge fan of the fries and typically get my salad or sandwich \"greek style\"--- which means they stuff a handful of fries onto my salad or into my sandwich for a small fee more. \n\nDon't forget to try the Baklava frozen greek yogurt!\n\nTry Souvla, you won't regret it.",

I agreed and felt the lamb was a bit dry but may be because the meat isn't served as warm,\ncausing the muscles and such to tighten. \n\nAgain due to the poor timing with the diet I'm on, we passed on the frozen Greek yogurt but when I come back I will totally get that bad boy and even opt for the pita.

I only get their chicken salad (didn't love the lamb and used to get the pork, but recently discovered their chicken salad is way, way better because the pork is usually kind of dry). Find the sandwiches to also be on the drier side (have only tried the pork). Their froyo is pretty good and servings are large. Will usually get the sea salt & olive oil combo as the other combos are too sweet for me. \n\nLines can get pretty long during lunch hour.

      "text": "Is it weird that I sometimes only come here for the frozen yogurt? I wonder if anyone else does that too... But yes, Souvla's frozen greek yogurt is just that good - especially the one with the baklava crumble and honey drizzle! I've been meaning to try the other flavors (olive oil drizzle or cherry syrup drizzle), but that baklava crumble and honey drizzle combo is keeping me from doing so. This place is a fast casual restaurant where you order up at the register, you're given a number, and they bring out the food to you. This location in particular is on the smaller side compared to the other ones around SF. There's a decent amount of seating inside, but during lunch hours, good luck finding a spot! Luckily they have additional outdoor seating, as well as a park a few steps away where you can sit and enjoy your food. Now for the food (besides the frozen yogurt) - I've only tried the chicken pita sandwich and the greek fries so far. The chicken pita sandwich was pretty good overall; the chicken had a well-balanced flavor and moisture and the veggie mixture inside of it was a nice balance, especially the oranges that added a great contrast. The pita bread was nice and fluffy, but I felt like the pita bread was disproportionate to the amount of chicken and veggies inside. The greek fries are just okay by themselves, but if you really want to elevate them and make them even better, get it with the harissa spiked greek yogurt sauce! It had a nice little kick and spice to it, but still had that slight greek yogurt acidity. Overall, Souvla is a great little spot for a quick lunch, but probably not something I would get on a weekly basis (except for the frozen yogurt) as the food is pretty pricey ($13 for the chicken pita sandwich and $6 for the fries w/ dipping sauce).",

The lamb is slow roasted in house and is amazingly tender. I love the pita here as well. Just a heads up, this place is typically busy so it may be difficult to find a table, especially if you're with a larger group. The food comes out fairly fast as well!",

      "text": "The Souvla food truck opens at 10 am and sits in the Hayes Valley park on a sunny piece of concrete scattered with bistro tables and chairs. The menu offers a thoughtful variety of both meat and vegetables, each of which can be made into a sandwich or salad. My lamb wrap came with pickled red onions, feta, and garlicy yogurt sauce, the meat for which wasn't gamey or tough at all. The cubes of lamb could have stood up to a more piquant marinade, perhaps a combo of red wine or red wine vinegar, lemon, and evoo, and the sandwich was calling for some dressed spicy greens to gussy up the textured flavors. I ordered a Greek iced tea, which wasn't too sweet, making that a complementary choice for the assertive flavors of the sandwich.",

So here I go, dragging my mom to come have an early dinner with me on a late Tuesday afternoon, and lo and behold! No line! \nOur two chicken gyro-type \"sandwiches\" and Greek fries came out in less than 5 minutes. The chicken sandwich tasted like a gyro from a more American perspective. If you're looking for the typical chicken kabob-type gyro that has tomatoes, lettuce, and lots of yogurt sauce, it's not what you'll get from Souvla. But despite that, I really enjoyed this unexpected gyro, with its oranges and radishes and all. The pita bread used was also great.\nWe ordered Greek Fries as well and I don't know about y'all, but for some reason, Mediterranean places make the best fries, and this is no exception. Just get them; they will complete your meal.\nAnd of course we had to try the frozen Greek yogurt! I love baklava, so I could've used some more baklava in it, but that's just me being greedy. The yogurt itself was refreshing, tangy like your favorite 2% original Fage yogurt cup, and after having it, you will never wanna go back to that self-serve froyo again. \n\nSouvla is wonderful spot in beautiful Hayes Valley if you want a quick, quality bite!",

      "text": "Souvla is my go-to for casual weeknight dinners with a friend or three when I'm trying to eat good food without blowing my entire budget on a single meal.\n\nThe menu is fairly basic: your choice of pork, chicken, lamb, or sweet potato in your choice of salad or sandwich. Both are excellent. I usually order chicken, largely because of the aesthetic window of rotisserie chickens spinning on the back wall (also because it is usually tender and delicious) but the pork and lamb options are also solid. You can't go wrong with any of the meats. I typically order salad so that I can feel healthy enough to follow it with frozen Greek yogurt. The baklava crumble & honey topping is a delightful conglomeration of textures and flavors. I would also recommend the olive oil and sea salt.\n\nBe prepared to wait, or plan to arrive a bit earlier or later than the standard lunch or dinner rush. You order at the cash register and they give you a number, which you can take to a table to wait (if you are lucky enough to find an empty one or stealthy enough to snag a seat as the previous patrons finish). After many visits, I've observed that the line typically gets longer on the hour, especially if you are going at a peak time (e.g. Friday or Saturday dinner).",

Both the baklava and honey was a nice contrast to the tartness (not super, super tart) of the frozen yogurt. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this. \n\nTIP: it's a pretty small space.

They do a few things and they do it well. \nYou can choose from pork, chicken, lamb, and veggies and have it as either a wrap or a salad. The salad usually costs a dollar more than the wrap.  My facorite is the chicken salad which comes on a huge bed of kale. It's surprising how large and filling the salad is, especially for the price. I would say the salad is tastier and a better value than what you would find at more salad-specific stores. The chicken wrap is good as well. It is more filling because of the pita, but also a bit greasy. \nThe fries here are AMAZING. Perfectly crunchy and seasoned and there are a lot of them too. For another dollar you can ask for a dipping sauce. Harissa mayo is very good. \nDrink-wise they have a large selection of beer, wine, and nonalcoholic drinks. I wanted something and the cashier told me that the cherry soda is quite sweet so I went with the Greek iced tea which came out of a bottle (they don't brew it themselves). It tasted like an herbal Arnold Palmer kinda. Not bad but nothing to write home about. \nThe only gripe I have about this place is how long the line can get on weekends, but I guess that's a testament to how good this place is.  All in all Silva has great food at a great value in a great location. What more can you ask for?",

      "text": "Sigh. I really wanted to like Souvla. I wanted to like it so much I went twice and braved the line each time. Usually if I'm neutral to negative about a restaurant, I'd rather try somewhere new than try the same spot again. Buuuuut I thought I'd give Souvla a second chance. Womp. \n\nThe first time I went I had the lamb salad. The salad was bland, lamb was gamey (also bland), and I didn't enjoy my meal at all. My brother gave me some of his lamb sandwich which was better, but not thaaaat great.\n\nI went last night with a friend for the second time. We both got the chicken sandwich. The chicken was gamey, dry, and extremely salty. The hot sauce on the counter didn't even help! #icanteven\n\nThe ratio of ingredients were pretty poor: two teeny tiny orange slices, a slither of greens and enough Mizratha cheese for one bite, all on an extra large doughy pita bigger than the size of my face. The pita didn't have any flavor either. Not sure what this mysterious \"granch\" dressing is, I didn't see a lick of it. \n\nI thought the entire meal could benefit from acid such as lemon, garlic, and a ton of sumac (being Mediterranean and all...), perhaps hummus, an herb such as dill, and cucumber. Tzatziki would be nice, too (yes, I know how to make Mediterranean and Greek food). \n\nWah wah.\n\nThe ambiance is cute and the frozen greek yogurt with baklava is fine.",

It was $14 which I guess is okay. Very quick service even though the line was out the door. Very tasty delicious tender meat. Next time I go I must get the fries which look thick cut, seasoned and divine. Happy to sit in the window and people watch.",

      "text": "I love Hayes Valley as much as I love finding new spots to eat. I was drawn to Souvla because I love BAKLAVA. So imagine combing frozen greek yogurt + baklava = genius!\n\nSo I payed a visit one Wednesday night and found Souvla to be very dark inside and somewhat cramped. The roasting meats on the rotisserie looked inviting but I wasn't too fond of the place. \n\nBut I wasn't there to eat dinner. I came there for the yogurt with baklava. The verdict? Well it had a nice tart flavor that complimented the sweet baklava. But it wasn't really the best baklava I've had. Also the yogurt wasn't too frozen and melted easily.\n\nIdk I wouldn't mind trying again IF I had a craving but I'm not in a hurry to rush back. I'd rather go to Baskin and Robbins lol.",

My sister usually gets olive oil and salt, which actually contrasts great with the sweet tart yogurt that you don't even need a sweetener. \nWe always get their veg salad which is also really good with huge chunks of sweet potato contrasting with the salty olives for a satisfying meal. Its such a signature taste that after I visited for the first time I realized I had tried their salad before from my sister's leftovers. It was the aha moment where I finally reunited with that salad. Great service too! The man at the cashier taking orders and preparing the yogurt is so friendly and understanding! Looking forward to trying their other dishes. But definitely the yogurt!",

      "text": "Mediterranean food is my favorite and unfortunately for me, this cuisine is generally a sore subject in San Francisco. I lived in Chicago for 6 years: home to a vibrant Greektown, real deal Lebanese shawarma, and more falafel than you can shake an olive stick at. So yeah - I miss it immensely!\n\nAnyway, after much trial and error, I've finally found really, REALLY great spit-fired meats (and being of Croatian heritage, I grew up on backyard spit-roasted lambs and pigs so I know my stuff). Souvla, you are the new 'it' kid in the Mediterranean (Greek to be more specific) category! Yes, it's pricey but I don't mind paying for a menu based on natural, vegetarian-fed meats from animals raised in a sustainable environment. \n\nI had a salad topped with pork that blew my mind... a bed of Romaine and kale topped with a very generous amount of American Homestead pork shoulder, cherry tomatoes, pickled red onion, thinly-sliced cucumber, and feta cheese all tossed with a minted Greek yogurt dressing. The portion was large and could easily serve as two meals if you start with the Avgolemono soup.\n\nAnd this sensational soup deserves its own paragraph: the classic Greek recipe is elevated with white mean chicken, buttery rice, and the perfect egg-lemon broth. This rendition is overwhelmingly crave-worthy... on the small side, but I'll definitely get it again. \n\nSouvla, you really hit it out of the park! I'll look forward to trying the olive oil yogurt next time. And a note to the owner: please open a location in SOMA or the FiDi!",

A revolutionary salad spot in Dallas called Bread Zeppelin, and most recently, a Greek spot in San Francisco called Souvia. This is going to be big. \n\nStar 1: How were the service and atmosphere?\n\nIn my mind there's a difference between \"gah look at that line what an inconvenience\" and \"wow look at that line that place must be LEGIT\". With Souvia it's very much the latter, but know that the layout is such that lines can easily pour into the street and even once you're inside you'll have people circling your table like a batch of vultures. \n\nEven so, the service at Souvia is fast and friendly, and that's largely thanks to what is a brilliantly simple menu. Pick your protein and how you want it and BAM. There is is. Dessert? Go for it, and you can expect it all in relatively short order. Star Granted. \n\nStar 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?\n\nI'll get right to it - my $12.00 chicken sandwich was huge, and I made a huge mistake by ordering some frozen greek yogurt to go with it. Now, $12.00 isn't exactly cheap (we're talking more expensive than a Chipotle burrito with double meat here), but as you can see in the picture this was a quality dish. Star Granted. \n\nStars 3 and 4: How was the food?\n\nThis was an excellent coming together of ingredients here: chicken, yogurt sauce of some sort, tangerines, clover, onions, and cheese. While I think the menu could be mixed up just a bit more with bowls and other offerings and the like, these sandwiches alone are enough to carry Souvla into franchise or multi-location greatness. Star Granted.  \n\nStar 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?\n\nWith a slightly more varied menu this is an easy yes, but even with the existing offerings I'll highly recommend Souvla to anyone who will listen. Star Granted.",

      "text": "Great casual counter lunch/dinner spot. I love the clean,  modern, chic decor with a large communal table but it can certainly get claustrophobic. The word has gotten out about this place and its safe to say there is always a line and a fight for the first come first serve seating. This bit, and the noise, makes for the experience to be a little less pleasant. \n\nThat being said, the food is outstanding. I love the minimalist approach to the menu; they offer 4 options to be served as a gyro or salad. All the gyros i've had taste fresh but with warmth of home-made / authentic greek food aspect. The restaurant also offers beer + wine and most notably a unique, frozen greek yogurt served with unique flavor options. Definitely worth sampling them all.",

      "text": "A friend and I stopped by for dinner on Wednesday night at 7PM and were able to find a seat pretty quickly. We both ordered the Lamb Salads, shared an order of the Greek Fries and had some greek wine, it was all delicious! The Salad was really fresh tasting and a filling size and had a lot of really juicy lamb meat. The fries were cooked well and with some hot sauce hit the spot. To top it off we got one greek yogurt with baklava crumbles and one with olive oil, sea salt and honey. The greek yogurt is tasty and the baklava crumbles are the way to go, we found the olive oil + sea salt + honey to be a little odd (mainly because of the olive oil).\n\nI would definitely go back again but would make sure to get there on the earlier end of dinner time because by 7:30PM it was packed with people waiting for a seat!!!!!",

Really delicious Greek-style wraps and amazing fries with cheese and olive oil.\n\nYou can pick 4 proteins- pork shoulder, chicken, lamb, and vegetarian and go for a wrap or salad option. I got the lamb gyro with pickled veggies and yogurt sauce in an awesome fluffy pita bread. SO GOOD. Protip: get it \"Greek style\" for 50c more and you get Greek fries in your wrap!\n\nThe salads are huge and looked delicious, so I'll be sure to try it next time. I got the frozen Greek yogurt with baklava and syrup for dessert. YUM. Perfect, tart yogurt, and delicious baklava crumbles. \n\nOne star less for the price - it can run a little high. My wrap was $14- it will make you full and they're generous with the meat portions. They also serve beer and wine.",

      "text": "Ok, let's get one thing out of the way first, this place is really expensive. $13 for a seat-yourself, Fast Casual Mediterranean wrap is a lot of money, even in this prime Hayes Valley location (the interior is also really nice/clean/modern and trendy).\n\nThat said, the food is REALLY good! The lamb wrap was likely one of the best I've ever eaten. Juicy and succulent and delicious. The pork wrap was almost as good as well. I'm also a sucker for Avgolemono soup. The lemony flavor is just so good, I can't stop eating it.\n\nAnyway I've been craving the lamb wrap and the lemon soup ever since the last time I ate here (which was a while ago!) so I would almost give this place 5 star if it wasn't for the price. Go try it! Just don't make it so busy that there's a big line next time I want to go!",

The oranges have never been sour, always sweet. The kale is never too tough or chewy. The chicken is out of this world. Always so hearty and generous. I love slathering it on a bed of greens. \n\nLove getting their fries as well. All about balance right? \n\nTop it off with any of their Greek yogurts.

Good.\n\nCombine all three above, and you'll be extremely full and happy for less than $25.\n\nOn the place itself, expect a line, though service is quick, and unless it's a weekend night you should be able to find a seat within 10-15 minutes.",

It usually accompanied by  an order of fries and a Greek frozen yogurt. Those items are amazing, but I feel the rest of the menu is lack luster and just average. That being said I havve co workers who love their salads so maybe my taste buds are the ones that are off. It's worth a try and usually very quick.",

The avoglemono soup was ok, nothing special. The greek fries were most enjoyable but even then they were a bit on the greasy side.\n\nThe decor is nice. I like the simplicity of the restaurant which was modern and very clean.\n\nWell, I'm not sure if it was just a bad day for lamb, but reading other reviews, doesn't look like we were the only ones to have this problem here. \n\nDon't think i'll be coming back until they are consistent with serving tender lamb. \n\nAnd for $45 for two meals and two sides, not including tip and we had no drinks was pretty expensive to me for lunch. I don't mind paying if the meal was worth it. This definitely wasn't worth it. It's too bad, really wanted to like it.",

The staff always greets with a smile and the food is on point. To tell you the truth I have not ventured far from the roasted chicken because it is THAT good!  In the back of the restaurant you will see the chicken slowly roasting on spics with the juices dripping down. If this doesn't get your salivary glands excited then maybe the smell will. The restaurant is small and always packed no matter what time you go. If there are no tables available take your food to go and sit in the park steps away. Souvla has salads at their perfection and hopefully one day will open another location closer to San Jose.",

      "text": "HUGE fan of Souvla and their items they carry on their menu. I usually only go to the location on Divisidero as its near my home, but today, I was in the Hayes Valley neighborhood with friends so we decided to pit stop in for lunch.\nAs always, there's a line, but it moves fairly quick! Service is good and food is prepared/delivered to table promptly. A little disappointed in my meal today though. I ordered the chicken salad, greek style (with french fries on top). All was good until about 10 bites in. A large horse fly, dead, crunched into my kale leaf with his eyes staring at me stopped me dead in my tracks. I was disgusted. \nI walk up with the item to the counter wondering what can be done to accommodate me. The server was busy taking everybody else's order so he told me the manager would come to find me shortly and prompted me to take a seat and wait. Well 15 minutes go by, still no salad, all my friends are still eating, and nobody has came to my table to discuss the matter, let alone provide me with another salad/meal.\nI walk up again to the front cashier to show face and to indicate I was not helped yet; and he said his manager was in a meeting but he would refund me anyway. I wait patiently for another few minutes until she finally walked out to greet me. She asked me what happened and she was nice, and apologetic right away. \n\nThey ended up refunding me my meal and making me a fresh new salad quickly. The second round was much better and all was good, but something tells me that kitchen ain't clean. Giving this Souvla 3/5 stars just for the lack of cleanliness in the back where everybody's food is prepared. Gross feeling to think about. \n\nOverall, still a great place to dine and I love their food, but I likely won't return to this location.",

My friends and I decided to stop by this place on our way home from brunch mostly because my roommates love this place and I was just infatuated by the NY style coffee cups.\n\nI got the frozen greek yogurt with baklava crumbles. It really is froyo textured greek yogurt but with the same greek yogurt flavors. The baklava was good but I actually found that it made the froyo a little too sweet for my liking because they sprinkle it on top as opposed to spreading it throughout the yogurt. If it was interspersed better, it might work better. I liked it enough though! It's basically an even healthier version of froyo right? frozen greek yogurt and all. It literally just tastes like froyo ... but less flavorful which I kinda liked on a hot Saturday afternoon.\n\ntldr; they have the cool new york style coffee cups !!! but otherwise, the frozen greek yogurt is pretty good!",

      "text": "The food at Souvla is so consistently delicious that they really can do no wrong. Anytime I'm in the area, we eat there because it's so good - if I lived closer, it would become a bad habit. The menu is simple, but there is no such thing as a bad order. \n\nMy favorite item on the menu by far would be the roasted white sweet potato salad. I don't know WHAT's in their dressing but it's super addicting. It's probably the most filling and satisfying salad you'll ever eat. Another great item is the lamb gyro; the meat is beautifully cooked and not super greasy. Greek fries are always a must no matter what entree you're ordering. Dessert is also a must: I highly recommend the frozen Greek yogurt with baklava crumbles and honey syrup. The sweet and sour flavor profiles are out of this world. In terms of their beverage selection, I've only ever had their Greek beer and it goes really well with the food (it's a refreshing lager). \n\nEverything else about Souvla is a slam dunk: their marketing/branding is on point and memorable; the space is clean and simple; the giant wall of rotisserie chicken is a sight to see; and ordering is quick and easy (unless there's a huge line). The one downside when it's really busy is the seating. It's pretty much communal seating but it does get super tight in the space when all of the seats are occupied. Food comes out super fast and you pick up the dessert separately (once you've finished your meal) so that it doesn't melt. \n\nDefinitely a more casual, quick spot, but the food is high class all the way.",

Parking was a little difficult but that was already expected. It was a nice day so even if we had parked far it was a nice walk to the restaurant. \n\nThe restaurant was small but very warm and welcoming. We sat close to the front with a counter and open window frame. Next time, I'll try going to the back patio. \n\nCleanliness (5/5): The restaurant was busy but everything was clean and ready for customers. Nothing else to comment! \n\nConnection (5/5): I like the simplicity of the menu. Makes reading the menu and ordering very easy. We didn't know what to order because it all sounded good so the cashier helped us navigate the menu. Throughout the meal, employees did ask us if we were okay or if we needed anything. The atmosphere is very casual and the attentive of the employees was excellent. \n\nProduct/Service Provided (4/5): I ordered the \"American Homestyle Pork Shoulder\" as a salad (you can order you dish as a salad or sandwich). The dish was very good and balanced. I usually dislike feta cheese but I wanted to try the dish as is. I think it converted me to eat feta cheese - it wasn't overwhelming and the size and amount of cheese complemented the dish. The only note I would make is there were a couple chucks of pork fat (which I would've been fine with if it were crunchier). Some of the pork was also a little dry - so there was some inconsistency in the various pieces of pork.",

I had an easy and pleasant experience dining here late on a Saturday night with friends.  I ordered the chicken salad, which was packed full of fresh lettuce, kale, and shredded chicken and topped with a refreshing \"granch\" dressing (made with greek yogurt). I don't even like ranch dressing, but I loved this \"granch\" -- it was healthy, flavorful, and a perfect pair to the salad.\n\nI also had the greek yogurt with sour cherry. It was super delicious, although I'd recommend trying something else if you prefer your fro-gryo sweeter. The sour cherry, true to its name, is definitely for lovers of all things tart.\n\nI didn't have wine, but my friends who did received very generous pours (an initial one, plus additional wine in a tiny carafe). No paying $12 for a thimble sized pour of wine here. I'm sold!",

We got the Baklava Crumble & Honey Greek Yogurt, which was fantastic! I had tried something similar at another Mediterranean restaurant in the South Bay, and this was definitely comparable, perhaps even better. The baklava was soft but still chewy, with the perfect balance of nuts and honey. The greek yogurt was not too flavorful either, and was a great complement to the baklava. I would definitely come back for lunch/dinner, and of course, for the dessert again!",

They don't happen often. \nIt was HAWT outside and SO HUMID inside the restaurant. I felt so sorry for the girl at the register standing in front of the oven. She was a trooper. \n\nMy friend had the American homestead pork shoulder ($10) w/ minted Greek yogurt, cherry tomato, pickled red onion, cucumber and feta cheese. It was ehhh okaaaay  but a tad on the dry side. \n\nI had the Superior Farms lamb leg ($12) w/ Harissa spiked yogurt, cucumber, radish, pickled red onions and feta cheese in a sandwich. THIS IS THE MONEY MAKER Y'ALL! That lamb leg was extremely tender and I loved the pickled red onions. I would be even happier if there were MORE pickled red onions. This thing was so damn juicy I was dripping all over the place. \n\nWe also split an order of the Greek Fries ($4) , which you should totally skip and not bother with. They weren't all that special although they were pretty crispy the way I like 'em. If you want yogurt, that's an extra $1. \n\nWe saw bowls and bowls of salad going out TOPPED with fries. A salad with fries!? I must go back for this...\n\nSouvla can be semi pricey for a quick lunch but it's Hayes Valley and they don't exactly have much competition. The place across the street sucks so don't even bring that up.",

The cheese, onions and bell peppers were a good combination, and the sausage was fragrant, just strangely kind of tough to eat.\n\nI've tried their sea salt and olive oil Greek yogurt. The yogurt itself is amazing, the oil is the most fragrant, pleasantly surprising part of this item, but I think the sea salt is pretty overwhelming. If you're looking for something sweet, go for the baklava frozen yogurt. The baklava is rich and delicious, and complements the cool, sweetness of the yogurt well. \n\nI usually, 100% will never order salad, but I make an exception at Souvla. Their pork shoulder salad is delicious, and it will last you 2 meals. The cheese on top is not too strong, and everything is a blend of incredibly healthy kale and other good greens. I have no idea what the dressing consists of, but it's light tasting and really enhances the salad in the right way. I'm willing to come back and try the chicken one (the pork in this salad tastes faintly like pulled pork without BBQ sauce)",

It almost read like an infographic! Also really liked the skylight inside.

You order up at the counter and then have your food brought out to your table. I ordered the Lamb Sandwich ($13) and Baklava Greek Ice Cream ($5). First of all, the sandwich had great presentation --very hipster. Unfortunately, it was so tough to eat that I ended up throwing away all of the lamb. It was so hard and flavorless. Somehow, I'm hoping I had a bad piece, but I couldn't even eat it. Instead, I opened up my pita sandwich and just forked out the radish, cucumbers, onions and cheese to eat. I never felt like I wasted my money so much. On the other hand, the greek yogurt is what kind of saved this place. I loved the touch of sour taste in the greek yogurt paired with their various toppings. Although the baklava was something new for me, it was a great option. I tried some of the Olive Oil and Sea Salt flavor from my friend and loved that one too, except I took a spoonful of too much salt. I'd be back for the dessert, but not so much the food.",

      "text": "I ordered takeout before they closed on a Thursday night expecting them to be annoyed because they close in 5 minutes, but instead I was surprised by the long line that went outside the door. Apparently they have this amazing frozen yogurt. By the way, it was the first day again where it is sprinkling in San Francisco and people were still waiting so I think I need to go back and try it.\n\nI ordered the \"Superior Farms Lamb Leg\" Sandwich ($13) It was good. I wouldn't say the most amazing mostly because the lamb was much chewier than other places I have gone to with falafel type sandwiches. This could have also been because it wasn't fresh. The sauce was amazing, and combined with their hot sauce it was way better.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the \"Mary's Free-Range Chicken Sandwich\" ($12) I took a bite and thought it was verrryyy good. The chicken was somewhat shredded, and it was soft, and combined with the sauce.. yum! Also his sandwich came with fries inside of them, and that definitely added to the goodness of it. (I also just love fries sooo)\n\nWe also ordered a side of Greek fries with their sauce ($4 + $1). Pretty solid. Again, they weren't fresh so I'm sure they're better than what I experienced.\n\nThis is definitely a place I would go to again. I would love to explore their menu a little more too!",

As the main course they have two options a sandwich or salad and 3-4 different types of meat. It is an even tie between the sandwiches and salads if you are going with atleast 1 other person I would highly recommend splitting a sandwich and salad and getting the chance to try both.\n\nThe lamb sandwich is very different from most places it has very fresh ingredients, great sauce added to it and overall a great find.\n\nTo top off the meal a must try is the olive oil and salt greek yogurt. It sounds like a unusual combination but the different textures go very well together.\n\nI would def recommend trying this place.",

The menu is basically pork, chicken, lamb or veg sandwich or salad and some sides. There is also some good looking ice cream served at the counter as well. \n\nWhen I came here, it was at 3 pm on a Friday on though there was not a line, there were still a fair number of people dining in. My friend and I decided to split a chicken sandwich and an order of fries. The chicken sandwich is supposed to come with \"\"granch\" dressing, fennel, navel orange, pickled red onion, pea shoots, mizithra cheese.\" I did not taste any navel orange or fennel, and there was only the slightest sprinkling of cheese. The sauce was not distributed evenly through the sandwich either. Not to mention, the chicken was dry and salty. The fries are supposed to come with cheese, oregano, and olive oil as well, but again, there was only the slightest sprinkling of cheese with no olive oil or oregano flavor either. What a disappointment. At least the price wasn't exhorbitant.\n\nService was fine and the other diners seemed happy, so maybe we should have just avoided the chicken.",

Chicken breast was tender and moist and went perfectly with the veggies. Next time I'd order dressing on the side. \n\nBaklava Greek Yogurt - This thing will keep me coming back! The yogurt itself has a little bit of tartness, but goes amazingly well with the sweet syrup and baklava. I'm still dreaming about this dessert! \n\nA good healthy alternative.

      "text": "Cute, greek place.  Lots of natural light, counter service, and surprisingly expensive.  Guest check for two modest eaters:  $38.07.  Order wisely.  And also, caveat emptor, there is a general sense of upsell pressure from staff there.  \"If you're dining in, why not a glass of greek wine?  Why not a side order of greek dressing for $2 more?\"\n\nAs for what we ordered:\n\nThe chicken bowl comes with kale and delicious greens.  I'd say that is a 4 star item.  My friend loved it, period.  I thought it was a tiny bit small for what I paid ($12) and a tiny bit overdressed with olive oil, but still really was the highlight of our food.\n\nThe lamb sandwich wrap--I love pillowy wrap bread, so I almost always prefer the sandwich over any platter.  The ingredients individually were all very well done and delicious, but they didn't work together as a whole.  And this lack of balance can easily be fixed. Specifically, here are the elements:\n* meaty (a little too much and also not cut in a sandwich friendly way), \n* sour (not enough yogurt sauce, so be prepared to shell out an extra $2)\n* comfy carb (pretty good, pillowy wrap bread), \n* fresh (way not enough vegetables), and \n* unctuous (olive oil literally dripping all over my hand and plate).  \n\nWhat most people may expect from the gyro memories of their past is a mystery loaf of lamb/beef on a spit, thinly sliced to be easy to eat.  This wrap is not that--it's 100% genuine lamb.  Suggested improvements:  I'd actually use about 3 less chunks and shred the lamb a little bit more.  Also, please pick through and remove the excess connective tissues.  On at least three pieces I ate, I was stuck with lamb gum.  I've uploaded a pic to get a sense of the inside of the wrap.\n\nFRIES:  excellent.  I happily ate them all, along with the rest of my $2 granch sauce.\n\nGreek yogurt dessert:  as the restaurant was starting out (day 6), many guests who talked up the owners got the dessert for free.  Alas, we paid for ours.  At $5 it seems pricey, but I would say it was really worth it.  One of the owners went through the trouble to get those once ubiquitous NY coffee cups (a very nice touch).  The yogurt itself had a beautiful sourness and tang and the toppings and sauces were unusual and just worked.  Chopped baklava?  Really worked!  Although it's more expensive than some places, it's one of the two places I will now eat frozen yogurt (the other being Fraiche).\n\nThe people working there were nice and knowledgeable.  But the suggestive sell element was less focused on my personal well being, and more on upping the already hefty guest check I felt.  So that put me in a guarded mood rather than a happy, neighborly one.  If you want me to buy a glass of wine, offer me a little sip at my table perhaps?  If you were expecting a $20 meal for two, this isn't it.  The guest check for the meal (wrap, bowl, fries, extra side of greek ranch, and yogurt) will set you back a whopping $38.07 + any tip you might offer.  And this is for counter service, not table.  Three stars for the sandwich not living up to its potential, quite yet.  If the sandwich improves, I'd give this place four stars. And a definite 4+ stars for the yogurt.",

Although I eschew the trendiest, most popular places because of the frequent overhype, I was recommended this place by the person who I came to visit in SF. \n\nWalked right in and ordered the chicken salad. The technology here is advanced compared to Maryland, and you pay for the tip on a tablet. I can't imagine Joginder ever having this at Metro Dhaba. \n\nI like the ceiling window that allows natural light to shine on my tanned arms. It's in an upscale neighborhood and the people around here are slightly boring. \n\nThe salad was very good. 5/5. Comes with free range Sonoma County chicken, tangerines, onion, cheese, some tasty dressing. They've got a common table in the middle where everyone can sit and talk about how ole Peggy Sue down the block didn't show up for her class. No but I saw most people playing with their iPhones. \n\nI enjoyed kind of blending into anonymity here.",

I later found out that the huge line was for this amazing beauty! \n\nI ordered the lamb sandwich for $13 and the frozen greek yogurt with honey & baklava for $5.

The chicken salad, which I've had twice, features juicy rotisserie chicken, onions, feta cheese, and tangerines. It may be a salad, but it's just big enough to be filling without making you feel overly full -- the perfect size!\n\nThere's a decent amount of seating inside, as well as a few tables outside. It's always pretty packed but you can usually grab a seat if you hang around for a little while. Ambience is very casual (you order and pay at a counter), which is great for a low-key hangout with a friend or if you're looking to grab something quick on the way home.\n\nGreat for those nights when you're just looking for something fast, fresh, and delicious without too much effort or fuss.",

      "text": "With a few changes, this could be a spectacular lunch spot. The number one thing that needs improvement is portion size, or something to change the value equation. There are two counters, the one at the front is for yogurt and the one towards the back of the space is for ordering food. \n\n*FOOD:\n\nLamb Sandwich: The meat was cut into uneven cubes, making it unfriendly for sandwich consumption and there were a few sinewy pieces that should have been removed. There was way too much meat and not enough of the pickled veggies or yogurt sauce to balance this sandwich out. If you want more sauce they charge you extra, which just seems unfair. This had mizithra cheese on it, which doesn't really melt and just acts as a conduit for salt. \n\nGreek Fries: Nicely crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. These came with mizithra cheese on top as well.\n\nGranch Yogurt Sauce: A nice take on ranch dressing, but it was $2 for this small portion. I know Chipotle charges the same for a side of guacamole, but unless they're using grass fed milk, it seems too expensive for a side of sauce. \n\nChicken Bowl: This was their rotisserie chicken with sprouts, on a bed of kale with orange segments and yogurt dressing. The portion on this guy was a bit small and I could have used a bit more roughage to round the dish out. Everything tasted great and I didn't think there was too much dressing (something I am sensitive to in general), but again, the portion was a bit measly. \n\nFrozen Yogurt w/ Baklava Crumbles: This was a very yummy way to finish our meal. The yogurt was creamy and fresh and the sweetness of the baklava balanced out the tartness of the yogurt. \n\n*VALUE: \n\n$12 for a lamb sandwich seems a bit steep, when all you're getting is the wrap by itself. The quality is great, but unless something changes value-wise, it's unlikely I'll be back. Also, charging $2 for extra yogurt sauce is just too much, especially since they wouldn't give me half portions of 2 different flavors of yogurt sauce to try when I asked. \n\n*ATMOSPHERE: \n\nIt was nicer inside than I thought it was going to be. Very minimal with some nice accents of foliage.",

      "text": "I was in Sf with my gf over the weekend and we decided to get some food from the Hayes district. This place is really good and I would recommend it if youre trying to get a quick bite that is more on the expensive side. I got the Lamb gyro and i wish it was better. The sandwich needed a sauce because the lamb was a tad bit dry. Perhaps some hummus would been perfect. Dicing the cucumber into small pieces then mixing it with some yogurt wouldve also done the job by adding some moisture to the sandwich. But overall good!",

And that's before dessert (which, I can't repeat enough, is their saving grace). Most importantly, the flavors are muted, despite their vibrant, Instagram/Pinterest-worthy colorful presentations. The kale in the salad is tough, the meats are dry and lack flavor, and the portions are oddly small, especially for coming either with a pita or in a massive salad bowl.\n\nThe space is bright, airy, and warm, though, and if you want a sweet treat after your meal, get the yogurt.",

The frozen yogurt is special- I don't usually like frozen yogurt but this stuff is good.\n\nThe reason I'm giving 3 stars is I feel strongly that their seating policy (or lack thereof) greatly decreases the enjoyment of the dining experience.  Yes, it's busy San Francisco, so hard to get a table at popular places, but the fact that you're totally on your own to find a table regardless of ordering sequence, set in stressful competition with fellow diners with whom you may end up sharing a communal table, hovering like hawks over those fortunate folks who are already eating, really creates a sour vibe.  I like sourness in my greek yogurt, not in my atmosphere.",

I find lunch places to be underrated on weekends and almost always undersubscribed. \n\nEnter Souvla - fast, yummy and what seems to be pretty healthy. The pork salad is both hearty and yet not overfilling - and the roast chicken one is also quite good. If your heart is set on starches I recommend the fries; the sandwich is decidedly less good than the salad. (Not typically my approach)\n\nAdd a bottle of their $27 Greek rose and a baklava and honey topped frozen yogurt and you've got yourself one hell of a meal. If it's a nice day outside Patricia's green and the ample seating in Hayes Valley is a great place to enjoy your meal. Otherwise swoop in on any open seat in the restaurant itself; the skylights give the space a super nice ambience during the day.",

The meats sometimes can be a little inconsistent, sometimes the lamb can be amazing.. And sometimes it can be dry, the chicken is for most always dry so I always avoid ordering that. I finally tried their pork shoulder.. And it is amazing!! But I would have to go back to order it a few times to see the consistency. It is really flavorful and you get bits of the crunchy fat? You can order the dressing on the side because sometimes it does get a little oily. Seating is limited here, so be sure to have one person to find a table while another goes and order if it you see that it is a little busy. Btw sitting by the rotating oven does get a little warm. The food also comes out really fast!",

      "text": "Everything I know about the Greek culture, I learned from My Big Fat Greek Wedding: Windex solves all problems. Greeks are basically Trinidadians, except one of us is on steroids. If I knew anything about my own culture I'd give you a final verdict, but I don't, so you have to figure it out yourself. \n\nMy friends parents, who are the loveliest parentals, treated us to a concert at the Nourse Theater and we wanted to meet up for dinner before. This spot seemed to be the best option health wise and I'm so glad we picked it. \n\nThe lines get long very fast, but it moves at a good clip. The one con is really limited seating: about four 4-tops, a community table that seats about 8, and bar style seating. I think there's a 2-top right outside. \n\nI had the Chicken salad and have yet to regret that choice. It comes with a nicely chopped kale/romaine mix, granch dressing, fennel, navel orange chunks, pickled red onions, and feta cheese. Oh man, I'm still salivating thinking about this. Their chicken is the best roasted chicken I've had in SF. The only competitor in my humble opinion is Bell Street Farm in Los Alamos. I believe you can order a whole chicken to go too, but if I'm not mistaken it's $20 and that's overpriced. \n\nWe also tried the Greek fries, and the juicy potatoes. The latter was OMG GET IN MAH BELLY. I might have said this out loud. Drink wise we popped a bottle of Greek Bubbles which was really nice, not too dry and really refreshing. Another table had the rose and hated it. We also had the floral & spicy red, which was as described.",

And you can ask for extra baklava. And you get it within 30 seconds of asking for it and you watch them fill a cup with swirls of the yogurt and it always feels like they're giving you extra.

      "text": "If you want to learn how to create/run a California-Greek franchise restaurant with integrity and skill, eat here and observe.\n\nThe concept: strip down a Greek restaurant to its essentials, and broaden the appeal by offering gyros as bowls. Elevate the ingredients. Make sure items can be assembled quickly, so turn around is quick. Apply these same concepts (simplicity, quality, authenticity, broad appeal) to the physical location. Charge a hefty premium. Execute the concept flawlessly. Rinse and repeat.\n\nWhen I got to Souvla with my wife, there was a line of about half a dozen people. It moved quickly. While I waited, I observed with growing admiration. The space looked modern (track lighting, copper tables) but was rooted in Greek culture (white brick and walls, wood floors, a blown-up old photo of a Greek man swigging ouzo and holding a chair in one hand, outdoor seating with hanging light bulbs) and had music calculated to appeal to the young tech crowd. Silverware and napkins were housed in attractive white ramekins, on the tables.\n\nWe ordered two bowls, one lamb and one sweet potato, a Greek fries, and a frozen yogurt with honey. The food was brought to us within minutes. The bowls, while very much in the California style, had authentic Greek flavors. The fries were tasty and maintained their crunch until they grew lukewarm. (Unfortunately, they also made my wife swell up like a balloon since she's gluten intolerant. I found out later from Souvla's website that the fries contained soy. I appreciate that the website has an Allergen page, but it might be a good idea -- and a smart sales move -- to mark the gluten free items with a gf on the restaurant menus.) The frozen yogurt finished off the meal in fine style.\n\nTo sum up, Souvla offers tasty food with broad appeal, very quickly, in pleasant, bright surroundings. I have no doubt the owners are making bank.",

Their lamb leg sandwich is phenomenal, even though it's on the pricier side ($13) for a gyro/sandwich. It's filled with fresh ingredients and will keep you full for hours. The juicy potatoes are cooked in rotisserie drippings, which means you'll probably not want to share.\n\nIt's easily a $20+ meal, or more if you order their frozen Greek yogurt. While I loved the consistency of the fro-yo, I wouldn't order honey as a topping again...it hardened quickly and I was basically scooping chunks of honey into my mouth.

Prior to this I had only had lamb in indian food. But man oh man this made me want to eat this all the time! So so good. Flavors were on point! We also had a pork salad and it was just as delicious. Souvla definitely knows how to get the flavors just right and make Greek food a favorite. The outdoor dining was so enjoyable and the ordering process was super easy. Overall, Souvla is a must stop for a wonderful meal!",

The contrast of the warm chicken breast pieces and cool kale, etc. simply worked. \n\nFriends got the french fries (cooked just right), and the lemon/egg/chicken soup which was described as  being \"surprisingly good,\" and \"cozy.\"\n\nFor dessert you can feel good about yourself with a cup of high protein greek froyo. I got the baklava kind, and yes, it was yumE. Everyone else got the olive oil and sea salt, and while too savory for me at dessert time, it tasted pretty good when I dipped a stray fry inside. \n\nYou'll probably have to wait to sit, or settle for bar seating, it's first-come-first-serve seating.\nShouldn't be too difficult if you come with one other person though. It's one of those places I find myself referring friends to who want something of quality that isn't going to break the bank.",

I will bring people here just for the dessert! Tart and sweet, oddly tasted like apple pie ala mode, which I'm totally happy with.

      "text": "Fresh, juicy, tasty and overall fantastic Greek food, people! \n\nFOOD: Everything was cooked just right. I ordered lamb Wrap (also available as a salad, which I'm going to try next time), and my taste buds were truly happy. The meat was very tender, juicy but not fatty, and it had just the right amount of seasoning/flavor. The wrap included thinly sliced cucumbers, radish, and pickled red onions. The bread was also delicious. Though the price of similar items is typically lower in the area, Souvla has all the rights to charge the amount they do, thanks to their food quality. And, the size was also very satisfying for a lunch option (perhaps, a hungry 200+ lbs man would want 2 of these though). \n\nSIDES: Souvla offers all their wraps in a form of a salad as well, plus they have Greek fries, salad, and couple other items on their menu. The Greek fries were wonderful! Lightly seasoned, perfectly cooked, golden and crispy with a touch of cheese. The fries complimented the wrap very nicely.\n\nSWEETS: The menu of this place is a minimalist's dream: everything is organized neatly, and, although there are only several options to choose from, all of them are very decent. As for desserts, Souvla offers their famous frozen yogurt. Of course, I had to go with the Baklava crumbles for the topping. It was great! The yogurt was not really frozen, it was just perfectly chilled, so you could taste the tart, sweet, creamy but light deliciousness under a layer of decadent, honey-crusted baklava! It was such a pleasant finishing touch to my meal. \n\nDESIGN: A very modern and elegant interior with a dash of ethnic beauty.\n\nSERVICE: 5++! Everyone at Souvla was super nice, the person at the front desk was very efficient and, despite the long line during lunch rush, our wait wasn't that long at all! We got our food ready in about 10 minutes. Plus, when we wanted to share 1 frozen yogurt in the end (couldn't go for a full cup after all the good food),  the front desk person served it in 2 cups with no problem at all. That kind of service does deserve 5 + stars!",

      "text": "This review is for the salad bowls we had a few weeks ago and today's frozen greek yogurt. \n\nWhat a Souvla filled day today, went to the Souvla for lunch on Divisadero and on my attempt to walk off the lunch, I was lured into Souvla on Hayes for a frozen greek yogurt topped with baklava and honey. For $5 this fro greyo is the bomb. I had the intent to eat half and save the other half for my boyfriend. Oh how that intention got derailed during my 5 min walk home. It was melting so fast that I had to eat it all... I mean what is a girl suppose to do when you have a delicious melting frozen greek yogurt? Eat it faster right? Needless to say, this was awesome and guilt free so I'll be back for more, next time with the boyfriend in attendance. \n\nOn a Thursday night a few weeks ago, we came and ordered one superior farms lamb leg salad and one Mary's free range salad. I've always loved the vibe and the colorful salad bowls, but when we got ours we were highly disappointed with the meat quality in the salad. Maybe it was late at night and only end meat shaving were left. Also they were short on ingredients, cucumbers were out for the night. Not a bad thing to experience as this shows that ingredients are fresh. However, I would have loved to have a substitution for the missing cucumbers seeing that I removed the cheese as well due to lactose intolerance. So my salad was looking a little sad. \n\nLikely will go back to the Divisadero location for a meal but will continue to come back to Hayes for dessert. \n\nOverall: \nFood/ drinks: 2/5 for salad bowls; 5/5 for greek frozen yogurt \nService: 1/5 - felt rushed through the ordering process and throughout the entire meal as a waiter came to take our bowls away about 3 times during our dine in while there was vivd amounts of food still in the bowls. \nEnvironment:  2/5- great decor, free wifi and self seating, self water service, clean the tables yourself, music is way too loud for conversations",

The lamb gyro was just okay - the wrap itself was underwhelming. \nThe greek fries were also amazing, especially with the greek yogurt ranch sauce. It has a lemony and tart flavor that's a little unusual at first to dip your fries into but I became instantly addicted.",

After I ordered the gyro I immediately noticed that almost everyone in the restaurant had ordered the salad haha. Retrospect is 20/20. The gyro was great though. I loved that it had fresh sprouts and mandarin oranges in it. I ended up just opening it to eat it with a fork to avoid the heaviness of the pita bread. We also had the garlic fries which were great crispy fries. For dessert we had the Greek yogurt. The yogurt itself was great, but the toppings kinda messed it up. It had A LOT of sea salt on it. Like way too much. And it was topped with olive oil which seemed bizarre. When I first saw it I thought it was honey but nope.. olive oil . My friend and I basically didn't eat any of it soooo yah. Sometimes less is more. Overall it was a great spot I would come back to and recommend.",

      "text": "I just realized I've never reviewed Souvla - which is damn right blasphemous.\n\nI live in the neighborhood and have eaten Souvla at least once (if not multiple times) per week for over a year. Feeling lazy but don't want to eat crappy take out? Get Souvla delivered (I use Caviar).\n\nMy go to is always the same:\nChicken salad with extra meat - the greens itself are sturdy, tasty, well balanced with a bright flavor that leaves you full without being bogged down. The chicken is also usually on point, but can occasionally be a little dry or fatty. The orange and fennel are HUGE bonuses.\n\nGreek fries + Garlic yogurt\nThese are just addicting, although delivery can leave them soggy. I don't blame Souvla though, that's the price for my laziness. I could eat the greek yogurt side with a spoon. The mizratha cheese they use is super sharp and salty, which I love. \n\nBonuses when I eat in:\nGreek yogurt with sour cherry (add sea salt!)\n\nGreek beverages (the iced tea and lemon drink are BALLER)\n\nI've had the chicken sandwich but the wrap they use is too thick for me, it dries it out. The salad is always the move. I've had the vegetarian salad, while the flavors were good, the sweet potato was a little dry for my taste. I dislike lamb and have been meaning to try the pork.\n\nPrice is a little steep, but it's Hayes Valley and the portions are big. \n\nBasically, I'm obsessed.",

They offer wrap and salad options, as well as their famous frozen Greek yogurt. \nDuring my visit, I enjoyed a lamb wrap which was DIVINE! The meat was perfectly cooked and the entire wrap had a unique and wonderful pattern of taste. Savory, yet with some sweet notes too. The yogurt was a great way to top everything off. I had the famous Baklava flavor. \n\nI definitely look forward to stopping by again!",

      "text": "We were extremely disappointed with the service and attitude at Souvla this week.  Our office had ordered take-out from Souvla before for meetings in the office.  This week, one of our secretaries mistakenly ordered food on Souvla's website for about 10 people on Wednesday and charged the order to her credit card.  She shortly thereafter realized that the lunch meeting was scheduled for Thursday and tried to cancel the order.  It took her several phone calls before she even reached a live person at Souvla.  When she finally reached someone, Souvla refused to cancel the order and our secretary had to pick up the food, even though no one on our team was there to eat it. She felt terrible but wouldn't let us reimburse her for the unwanted food.  She then had to reorder the food for our meeting on Thursday. \n\nSouvla's \"policy\" in this regard was heartless and reprehensible.  You can be sure we will not be ordering from Souvla again.",

It's the kind of menu that would be a go-to favorite of mine if it was better.\n\nThey do not cater well to a diary-free crowd; they use a lot of yogurt and cheese, rather than herbs and quality cooking. \n\nI decided on this third or fourth (and last) order to pop a Lactaid, cross my fingers, and order dishes with all the dairy to see if I really can't find anything that I like there. My husband and I shared two chicken salads (no changes) and a lamb sandwich (no changes). Neither of us cared for our food. The chicken isn't very good, the oranges on the salad weren't ripe, tons of cheese, yogurt dressing - really nothing interesting in the salad. Only positive was that the serving of meat was quite large. The lamb in the sandwich wasn't flavorful either; sandwich was pretty dry. Pita wasn't anything special. \n\nWas really rooting for this place, but can't get behind it.",

The veggie salad was delicious & amazing. It's always so crowded in there so you know it's a good place. They noticed I kept going up for water (there's a spigot in the corner by the register) & they brought me a jar which was very nice. The people are friendly, but I think they need a better system of filtering people through the shop. The registers are in the front of the store, and after you order, you're stuck kind of standing there until you can either get your food or find a place to sit. I also had the frozen Greek yogurt (the honey flower one), and that was good. Keep in mind it'll be kind of sour because it's Greek yogurt. It was good -- not sure if I'd get it again, but it's worth trying for sure. If you like baklava get that one!",

I love the concept, the simple menu, and sticking to the things that you can do better than anyone else around. The flavors here are off the chain, and you cannot go wrong with either the pita or salad. Also, the hype you're reading in all the other reviews about the frozen greek yogurt with olive oil and sea salt? It's not just hype, my friends. You really must save room for this treat when you come here. \n\nAlso, I just want to mention that while Souvla does Greek food extremely well, they don't take themselves too seriously. We came here with some friends for my husband's birthday, April 1, and they had completely transformed it into a taqueria for April Fools. They even hired a Mariachi band. So fun!",

I only managed to finish half and I was starving when I started the meal. \n\nFrozen yogurt: my friend and I concluded that this choice was healthy. It's frozen Greek yogurt after all. I had the wildflower honey and he had the cherry. Both super light and super \"healthy\" tasting.  ;)\n\nVibe: at close to 9pm, the place was packed.

      "text": "Souvla offered some fantastic Greek food! We arrived at 6:40 on Wednesday night and it was starting to get busy. The two tables outside were open but none of the tables inside had seats available. We grabbed three seats along the wall and ended up moving to a table as soon as some people got up. They have hooks under the wall tables surrounding the place which is a super plus. The communal table in the middle was great. It was roomy enough to share. Steve held down the fort while we ordered. My friend had the  Lamb Sandwich, I had the Chicken Sandwich and Steve had the Pork Salad. We also got the Egg and Lemon soup. The soup was delicious and hot. It had really good seasoning with bits of chicken but none of flavors were overpowering. The Greek sparkling mineral water and beer were both refreshing. You order efficiently and grab a number. The food is brought to you, served in white tin bowls in little trays. We loved our food. The bread they used to wrap the sandwich is chewy and held together well. I almost always have issues eating wrapped food but none of the stuff fell out. The paper and bread held everything together. I loved the pickled veggies and tangerine oranges with the meat. Everything tasted fresh and light. The salad was too hearty for me but my husband loved it. I don't like a mouth workout so the pieces of kale and stuff were too big for my liking. Steve very much enjoyed the salad just the way it was. We ended the night with Baklava Yogurt and French Fries. Both \"desserts\" were great. The Fries were cooked nicely and had yummy lemon seasoning. The Baklava Yogurt had the perfect tanginess and sweetness because the flavors complemented each other. The service was great and the place was clean. Even the restroom was tidy. You can see into the kitchen while you wait for the restroom and the kitchen looked clean and well organized. A HUGE line formed while we were eating and many people had to wait for a table. The line was steady even after we were all done eating. It's a very popular place and worth it.",

For a sunny and hot day, it was the perfect thing!\n\nWhen we walked in, we went to the register to order. Their menu is pretty simple, you choose your protein and you can get it in a wrap or salad. We both got rotisserie chicken salad and shared fries. We got our number and found a spot at the bar. Our order came very quickly! \n\nChicken salad: I was expecting mixed greens or iceberg but the salad was filled with kale with sprinkles of romaine! There were a ton of ingredients in there. It had pickled onions, pea shoots, chicken, nuts, and I can't remember what else! It was delicious and so filling! \n\nFries: so good! Crispy and perfectly seasoned. You don't even need to dip it in anything. \n\nOn our way out, we noticed a frozen yogurt bar on the left side. We got samples .. walked out .. then walked right back in to each order our own. We both got plain greek frozen yogurt. It was so good .. creamy yet light! I noticed they had frozen yogurt with baklava crumble .. I have to try that next time! \n\nThis place looks like it can get pretty busy during lunch hours and might be hard to find a seat! But definitely worth a try!",

Yes, the wrap is huge and unwieldy and drips all over, but recognize that that grease dripping out of your wrap is melted animal fat, i.e., liquid deliciousness! So I say keep your head down, enjoy that luscious animal fat, and file Souvla away in your head as not a good first date place.\n\nThe wrap wasn't perfect, though. Ours came out slightly warmer than room temp and I can only imagine how much more amazing it would be if it had been hot. Same with the pita - it was on the hard end and lacked fluffiness. Again, the whole wrap would have been elevated with those small details.\n\nStill, all the ingredients were fresh and tasty. It's not the cheapest fare ($11/wrap), but you get what you pay for at Souvla.\n\nAlso: note that it gets incredibly busy around dinner time, so scout out tables after you place your order!",

      "text": "I visited this restaurant this weekend on a trip to San Fran. I was very disappointed to find that my company and I was racial profiled. We paid using a $100 bill then we told the cashier we would be back for the food. She accepted our money and told us the food would be ready when we got back but when we reappear, I notice my food was not ready after 15mins. That's when the manager, Levi, came up to us and told us that our money was fake. He would not believe it was a real bill because he used a test from 1990s that he swore was not broken. We told Levi to come with us to the Bank located a few blocks away and there they confirmed the bill was REAL. Levi apology for the inconvenience because he felt like a fool for racially profiling us. He only checked the $100 that we paid with because we were black, made us walk to the bank with him because we were black, and then tried to make us walk in the private door when we got back to the store because we was black and he was wrong. I have a video but was not able to upload it so I attached photos of this. Needless to say I never tried the fool because they tried my soul. Seem like the food would be good but with racially driven staff I doubt it. We went to Tacolicious instead- got great food and service.",

It's super casual, yet there's still some ambiance as they dim the lighting and they offer wine. (It's a seat-yourself type of deal.) Be prepared to get a bit cozy with your company and neighbors, as it's a very small restaurant with limited seating. You won't have to wait for long though, as it's a place to just sit down for a quick meal (eat and get up within an hour). Perfect if you're already dressed down, and suitable for a quick bite before heading out somewhere. Salad was very fresh and well-portioned, though the pork was a little fatty.

      "text": "I've been to Souvla a couple times. The first time was for a mid-day meeting with colleagues. At my initial visit, it wasn't very busy since it was around 4 in the afternoon. We were able to grab a couple seats to enjoy their frozen Greek yogurt which was creamy, rich, and slightly tart. I had one with sour cherry syrup and my colleagues had the more popular one with baklava crumbs. I was impressed and vowed to return for an actual meal.\n\nLast night, I went in for dinner with two friends around 7:30 PM. Fearing this was prime dinner hour on a Friday and that there would be hoards of eager San Francisco yuppies, we were prepared for the worst. Thankfully, the line wasn't too bad and we were able to find seating thanks to a family of three that was on their way out. (Seating is first come, first serve.) Every seat was taken and just like the city itself, all space is valuable real estate in a small space like Souvla! \n\nSo how does Souvla work? You take a quick look at the paper menu at the door, and if you're like me you let your happy hour buzz dictate your ordering. That said, with gentle prodding from my oh-so-convincing buddy, I succumbed to wine temptation by ordering a pretty pricy glass of sparkling Greek wine. It was solid, but for a glass that rang up $12, I was hoping for more memorable vino. It was bright with notes of citrus (I'm being partly serious and partly facetious since I don't have the most sophisticated wine connoisseur palate.), but again, I didn't particularly feel that was a good value. Speaking of things not being of good value: the lamb sandwich ($13). Now, I know we live in San Francisco and with Hayes Valley being one of the hubs of bourgeois taste, I still have sticker shock for food that would otherwise be several bucks less elsewhere. The lamb sandwich comprised of chunks of spit-fired lamb leg, harissa-infused yogurt, red onion, cucumber, radish, and feta cheese tucked inside pita. The lamb was prepared well though it could've used more seasoning and wasn't as tender as you'd expect for its cooking method. The accompanying veggies and especially the feta cheese were nicely toothsome. However, I remember the sandwich served at room temperature which was disappointing when I was hoping for some hot meat in a warm pita to go with the chilled sparkling wine. \n\nThe dining room is rather loud so expect to talk very audibly... or go right ahead and do a little shouting if necessary because it's a packed house if last night is like every other night. Again, seating is tricky here. We were eating for about 20ish minutes and 15 of those minutes, there were people literally standing next to our table peering over to see how fast we could eat and how quickly we could drink -- which made eating, at times, a bit stressful. When you can feel the weight of multiple eyes on your table, one cannot help but feel pressured. \n\nIn all, Souvla serves up terrific frozen Greek yogurt but, for me, dinner and the ambiance were middle-of-the-road at best. Thankfully, with wonderful company and lovely friends with you, you're more forgiving of these things as you dine. Souvla is, in the words of Yelp, a solid \"3-star, A-OK\" joint: good, but not enticing enough for me to return.",

I definitely love the idea of frozen Greek yogurt, especially since there are so many dessert options in the area, having a healthier one is very welcome!

The sweet and salty combo from the cheese and the sweet potatoes is a nice twist. \n\nThe food itself is excellent.

I thought I'd be wowed by the food but honestly it was just ok. The gyro sandwiches are wrapped in what seems to be a  home made thick pita bread . That sounds like it should be super good but the bread was too thick and had no flavor to it so it only added bulk and unfortunately added to the  dryness of the sandwich . We got one of each the chicken and the lamb sandwich . Both were super dry, begging for moisture which was not achieved from the scant sauce which was added in the middle of the gyro.  There just wasn't much flavor going on in the chicken gyro so I felt like I had to douse it with salt and pepper. They add orange slices to it which Also doesn't do much . The potatoes and the fries were excellent. It was a bummer we could not find any ketchup for the fries anywhere . There was only hot sauce on the tables which did not  complement anything .  The yogurt dessert was good but did not wow us. Overall it was just ok and pretty pricy -$58 for 2 sandwiches, 1 fry, 1 order potatoes, 2 yogurts, 1 ice tea and 1 bottled water . That's a bit steep for a seat yourself quick eat.  If you're ever in the South Bay, hit up \"Nick the Greek\" for a great tasting gyro meal - it is still my go to for tasty quick Greek food.",

I didn't feel like the only vegetarian entree they had - grilled sweet potatoes and some other stuff as a sandwich. I opted for a small side salad and fries. They were both good though I'm probably not the only person who will be glad to see the fad of kale in salads pass. There was regular lettuce too but lots of chopped Dino kale. And I adore it cooked - probably have it twice/week. A guy working there popped by a tiny portion of their yogurt ranch sauce for the fries saying it was left over and he didn't want to waste it. It usually costs $1 extra. It was good, especially as a freebie. \n\nMy favorite part of the meal was the frozen Greek yogurt. The yogurt itself was rich and a bit tart. Very delicious. We got one with olive oil and a little too much salt and another with honey. The olive oil and salt was amazing with the yogurt but it was over salted. The honey tasted good but was hard to eat when the honey got cold.",

However, several of my coworkers had raved so much about Souvla that I finally decided to give it a try... and boy am I glad I did! \n\nI ordered the pork shoulder sandwich ($11) with a glass of the sparkling greek rose ($12) and man, was it one satisfying lunch! The meat is so tender and bursting with flavor and the creaminess of the minted greek yogurt and feta cheese coupled with the extremely soft pita bread was to die for! Also, the sparkling rose was perfect to unwind over on the hot afternoon. Perfectly paired. \n\nI highly recommend trying Souvla for a transformational gyro experience! It's a cute and small restaurant tucked into the heart of Hayes Valley - definite must-try. \n\nHappy Eating Yelpers!",

The food was quickly made and fresh.\n\nRoasted chicken salad - Salad had a good amount of free range pulled rotisserie chicken dusted with a mild cheese, mizithra (kind of like cotija meets feta) With the combination of ingredients, it was texturally too rough with the kale and fennel. Kale salads can be on the bitter side, but the orange slices and fennel didn't quite balance it in sweetness but stood out on their own. Chicken was pretty good and moist. I'd say it's on par with a Split Bread quality salad.\n\nFrozen greek yogurt (olive oil and sea salt) - Yogurt is a soft serve froyo consistency watery and icy but still rich in flavor. Sweet, but not overbearingly so like Pinkberry or anything. The combination of sweet, salty, tangy and savory was highly addictive.\n\nHealthy and clearly high quality eats, but kind of on the pricey side.",

I always applaud an owner who takes a hands-on approach.\n\nThe food... I really enjoy the simplicity of their menu. There are three meat options and one veggie option. They all come either in a wrap or as a salad. The salads are particularly amazing. The meat portion is very generous and the meat itself always juicy with great flavor. The chicken salad has mizithra cheese, pickled red onions, kale, and orange segments which create a great complement to the rotisserie chicken and an awesome balance of flavors.\n\nWhile I've been less impressed with the greek yogurt, it still satisfies my sweet tooth fix. However, I come here for the entrees, the service, and the dining ambience. \n\nIt does get crowded, and seating is very limited.

There's a great balance of flavors in each heavy gyro. I admit, some of my friends think the sandwiches are on the greasy side, but the pita performs a superb and sinful role of saving the precious meaty juices.\n\nThe Greek Fries are, hands-down, get-in-my-mouth-right-now good.

      "text": "Coming from Toronto which is famous for Mediterranean cuisine and its \"Taste of the Danforth\" Greek festival, I've always been disappointed in SF's greek food game. That said I was pretty excited to try this place but each time I've been here was a less than mediocre experience.\n\nThe toppings for the chicken wrap is a creative combination of flavors. The orange is a nice touch; however, they are pretty conservative with the toppings. And I can't say I'm impressed with the rotisserie chicken. I've had it a few times and it's consistently bland and dry which is really atypical for rotisserie chicken so I don't know what their problem is.\n\nThe fries are a scam. Avoid it. They're $4 and the description paints this picture of these fancy fries with olive oil, lemon juice, cheese, and parsley on it. BUT IT'S A LIE. You don't taste ANY of that because they only put on a microscopic amount (same deal with the wrap). It might as well be plain fries. So I ask a server about sauce and apparently it's an extra dollar. So then you have to wait in a big line again just for some sauce while your food gets cold. Then the $1 sauce is hella tiny, only good for like 3/4 of the fries even if you're a conservative dipper. If you're liberal dipper you'll probably need 3. And no, they don't have ketchup.\n\nAs for portions, they don't work for me. The wrap is too small and the fries are too big. I can't finish both but I'll feel unsatisfied after just the wrap. For $12 \"fast food\" I think that's unacceptable. And I'm definitely not the only yelper who feels the same way.\n\nAnother annoying thing about this place: it seems to always be busy and people are always hella gunner when getting a seat. I always see people sitting down without order numbers and I'm just standing around holding a number in a super congested area like an idiot, servers constantly trying to get around me. Look, if a place is full, you don't get to sit down before ordering. We've ordered. We need a place to eat. Wait your freaking turn.\n\nOn the other hand, the frozen greek yogurt with baklava is really great and that's really all I come here for.",

      "text": "How did I not know about this place until 2016?!? Souvla is one of my favorite new restaurants, and it's partly because of their greek yogurt with baklava crumbles and syrup. The yogurt is the perfect amount of tartness and baklava is just plain delicious so this combination made my tastebuds happy!\n\nMy first time going was a Friday night, and it was obviously pretty busy but my friend and I were able to get seats at the bar. Is it even a bar or just a serving station? Either way we got to see glistening meat rotate and cook only 5 feet away from us, which only made me even hungrier! I got the lamb wrap, and it was very tender and juicy. After eating the yogurt first, I couldn't finish my lamb so I had half to take home, and it still tastes good the next day! \n\nI was creeping a bit and seeing what other people got, and I have to say the salads at Souvla actually looked pretty good too. Definitely come here if you're in Hayes Valley, but try to come with just 1-2 friends or you'll have a hard time getting seats!",

      "text": "Souvla is so good, it put the other Greek spot down the road out of business. \n\nThe are many reasons why this cafe/restaurant rocks, but it mainly boils down to:\n\n1) THE DECOR: In typical Hayes Valley fashion, the space is adorably chic, minimalist and modern. It bears little resemblance to other more traditional Greek restaurants -- ornate carpets have been replaced with hardwood floors, clunky wooden furniture with industrial metal stools. \n\n2) THE FOOD: I've had the Greek fries (incredibly crispy and seasoned with olive oil, lemon juice, oregano and mizithra cheese), avgolemono soup (basically egg-lemon soup with rice and chicken -- one of my favorite soups in the world -- though I will say Kokkari's version is better) and a lamb gyro (complete with yogurt, cucumber, radish, pickled red onion and feta). The meat came right off the rotating metal spits on display and was so damn tender and flavorful. I've still got my eye on their brunch menu, Greek salads and Greek yogurt though ... next time!\n\nSadly, seating is limited. There's really only one large table which in my experience is usually occupied; the others are all tables for four, unless you opt for the bar seating in the back (but then as everyone knows you can't face your friends while eating which is a major bummer). Ah well. Think of Souvla when you want to catch up with 1-2 friends max and you'll be fine.",

I was lucky to arrive right before a fresh rush and to find a place to stand at a table outside to wait for my to-go order. \n\nMy high expectations for the food were not met. Both the pork and the chicken were surprisingly bland - I agree with the nyt article where they had to add more feta to the brine. Additionally, there were some chunks of fat (not nicely rendered and tasty, just globby) & connective tissue in both the chicken and pork - a little of this is not a big deal, but it was excessive to me. \n\nThe rest of the components of both sandwiches were quite good and interesting, although there wasn't enough of them to make up for the bland meat.\n\nBut, the fries were excellent, and the salad was pretty good.",

It's seat yourself, and so folks are looming over your table, waiting for you to finish your food. Too stressful.\nLuckily, there are some seats outside.

The key here is to swoop swoop swoop another table as soon as someone's leaving. With a line out the door and a small footprint, you gotta be fast.\n\n-Veg Sandwich (4/5): sweet potato is the star here, and I'd eat this any day. The garlic in the yogurt is the strongest flavor; the other ingredients (myzithra, walnuts, pickled onions, kalamata onions, pea shoots) are pretty subtle but together make for a satisfying entree.\n-Fries (3/5): the fries themselves are solid but the lemon is undetectable and the myzithra (which I love) nearly nonexistent. There's an herby flavor from the parsley. Nothing to write home about. Sadly the potato side is not vegetarian.\n-Soulva Greek Red Wine (2/5): I'm not a wine connoisseur but it was pretty disappointing. The 500ml mug makes for two very generous glasses.\n-Baklava Crumbles & Honey Greek Froyo (5/5): THIS IS WHY YOU COME HERE. Mmmmm soo good. The froyo is thick and tart, which helps balance the very sweet baklava and honey. If you ask nicely they'll give you extra baklava for free. Get it to-go and eat it in the park.",

      "text": "Honestly, if I were to rate Souvla based just on their salads, I would've just given 3 stars, but their Greek yogurt really bumped them up to a 4. \n\nThe salads are a reasonable portion, but I still think they're a little pricey. It's like $13-15 for one? I had the chicken and my friend had the pork. They were SOLID, but for that price and the popularity, I kinda expected something that would knock my socks off. I ordered the chicken knowing that it was from their own rotisserie, but it had this dry texture even though it wasn't necessarily dry. Maybe it was the (excessive) dressing that made it seem like it wasn't dry. Aside from it not being anything spectacular, I got quite a few bits of bone in my chicken.. I didn't make any complaints or return it but thought I'd just mention that. Also, the chicken could be shredded in smaller pieces? I know knives are provided but I personally just don't like using knives in a bowl LOL. \nThe pork in my friend's salad was a little on the salty side but I guess the flavor was there. Had that dryishness also. \n\nNow for the greek yogurt! It was the perfect dessert!! It was so delicious, you'll definitely like it if you like greek yogurt. The yogurt itself was super creamy and perfectly tart but still sweet! I had the baklava crumbs on mine and I honestly was worried I would run out of topping befoe I finished my yogurt, but there was the perfect amount to have it dispersed all the way! If you like nuts&cinnamon I definitely recommend this one. My friend got the wildflower honey and that was so aromatic! I recommend that one if you like floral flavors (: \n\nOverall, Souvla is super cool. I love the decor, it's super bright and clean and the workers are nice (they have cool aprons too). I could skip their entree items, but definitely recommend their greek yogurt. It's something worth coming for. Prices may be a little up there for what you get but it's SF so eh. Oh yeah, just a tip, the lunch rush is crazy. Everybody's there LOL. 4 stars.",

I ordered the chicken gyro and we got greek fries to share with greek ranch. The combination of the chicken, orange and onions was great and I could tell the chicken was of good quality. The fries were amazing and I could've eaten the whole basket by myself! \n\nThis is a small place where you order at the counter and it's seat-yourself. I would recommend take-out if you don't want to wait for a table but if you get lucky, it's a really cute place to sit and eat.\n\nI'll definitely be back to try their greek yogurt that is so famous! After an entire gyro, you're too full to try that as well :(",

      "text": "Amazing salads! I've tried the chicken and the vegetarian, and both are healthy and delicious. I think they use Greek yogurt as a base for their dressings so it's healthier than a normal dressing. Their salads have the perfect ratio of kale to iceberg, and of each veggie/meat/dressing or other ingredient. My mouth is watering just thinking about their salads! I routinely walk one mile round trip from my office to eat their salads for lunch, because they are that good even though it's out of the way.",

First off they have a clean hipster lookin vibe to it. The vibe is great. They amazing chicken salads here that you have to try as well as their Greek yogurt and Greek fries! What I love is that the salad is so filling I got fully satisfied both times! I recommend it to anyone. The parking sucks really bad and the meters are expensive but it is so worth it. The workers are really nice. 5 stars all around!",

      "text": "Tried Souvla for the first time the other night...  I was looking forward to it because I had heard good things from a few of my friends.  I was not disappointed...\n\nI loved the look and feel of the place.  It so reminded me of the smaller little restaurants in Greece.  Bare floors...  Greek homey decor...  and not overly lit.  And although the music wasn't Greek, I did like the selection that was somewhat underground and hip.  In Greece, they would be playing music like that if they weren't spinning Greek tunes.  Of course being \"hit\" with the sight and smell of the delicious rotisseried meats was a big plus!\n\nThe food was delicious, and honestly, that was the most \"home cooked\" meal I've had at a restaurant in a long time.  The food is honest...  everything tasted fresh and natural and the choice of seasonings were perfect.  I had a lamb pita sandwich...  the generous portion of lamb was succulent.  It was complimented by a slight twist on tradition, which I believe worked really well.  Usually, Greeks will just throw on some tomato, onion and a big blob of tzatziki, but this sandwich featured cucumber, pickled onion (which I love), and feta, which was all held together by yogurt which was spiked with harissa (red pepper sauce).  The flavors were all complimentary without any one being overpowering...  just the way it should be!  Also, this was served on what appeared to be a homemade pita!\n\nFor my side, I chose the Juicy Potatoes, which were roasted and coated with the meat drippings!  A little herbaceous spices gave the dish even more character.  I thought this was a great alternative to fries, as it reminded me of my yiayia's potatoes, (yes, I am Greek).  However, the fries that I saw looked amazing, and I will try those next time.\n\nI topped that off with a cold Greek beer, which with the food and the atmosphere, brought me back to Greece.\n\nAnd as if I wasn't full enough...  I'm just a glutton for punishment, I had to try the frozen Greek Yogurt...  which I topped with Visino, the Greek cherry syrup...  yep...  my journey back to Greece was complete!  Cold, tangy yogurt topped with that deliciously intense and sweet syrup just completed the experience.\n\nKudos to the staff who are all very friendly and helpful!\n\nOnce again, I will stress the quality of the food here, both of the food and in its preparation.  I walked out feeling satisfied that I had a nourishing and gastronomically fantastic meal.  I will be back...  I haven't gone through the whole menu yet!",

We all really enjoyed our sandwiches, though mine was a bit greasy at the end. My friends also split a side of Greek fries, which they enjoyed, but I thought could use a little more olive oil. The Greek fries I've had at other restaurants are usually drizzled in a good amount of olive oil (it helps the cheese and herbs stick!), but if you're not into that they taste perfectly okay, with a sprinkling of parsley and mizithra cheese.\n\nAll in all, you can't go wrong here!",

The only thing is that there wasn't enough of any of it to make the sandwich more evenly balanced and interesting. \n\nMy husband got the pork sandwich which did have more evenly dispersed cucumber and even tomato(!!), but the pork itself was lacking.\n\nWe got a side order of fries which were good. The honey Greek frozen yogurt dessert was delicious!\n\nOverall, it's worth trying, but I'll be continuing my search for good Greek food in the city. \n\nTIP: If you get there by 6:30 pm, it's easy to get a table. After that you're likely to wait in line.",

The one nice thing is that the guy at the register warned us that the food comes out quickly so we might want to find a seat before ordering so that we weren't standing around holding our food waiting for a seat. I really appreciated that! The veg salad and the lamb salad were great! \n\nThis place is small, but the service was good and the good came out quickly. \n\nI am looking forward to returning and trying one of their frozen yogurts.",

It tasted so fresh and the pea sprouts and citrus gave it a unique artisanal flavor. The lamb was great too with its own unique toppings. Can't go wrong with the Greek fries either... mmm garlic. I have yet to try the frozen yogurt but am excited to give it a taste! It also looks a bit unique.\n\nNot only was the food amazing but so was the decor! A sweet industrial chic interior and I couldn't stop looking around as I was eating. It was the small touches that got me pumped--the plates, small carafes of water you can bring to your table. Next time I go I'm definitely taking a pic. I'm a sucker for cool interior design. All around quality! I would def recommend this place!",

The place is small or \"intimate.\"  There is bar seating outside for about four people total. Back to the salad--- a little different on a Greek take, actually not sure that it was really a Greek salad but it was good. The chicken taste like rotisserie; it had romaine lettuce and kale; there prices of mandarins in the salad; and it had a type of yogurt dress along w/ some olive oil and what tasted like cijota cheese. Again, it was like Greek w/ a twist. Oh! And the frozen yogurt was a nice, creamy, and smooth!!",

I ordered a Superior Farms Lamb Leg wrap that comes with Harissa-spiked yogurt, cucumber, radish, pickled red onion, feta cheese and lamb. It was goos except that the whole wrap was very oily. The type of bread used reminded me of Manaeesh from back home, which was delicious. Along the wrap, i got side of fries that were really good as well (wish the quantity was more though) and the Greek Sour Cherry yogurt which is the best yogurt i have yet to try. That yogurt is the bomb and super delicious! Definitely recommend to  get it. Total price was around $22 which is not too bad. I was impressed by this restaurent and would definitely order more next time.",

That said, the Greek yogurt is amazing and something I crave often. Both the baklava and sea salt flavors are drool-worthy. And unless you know how to make yourself a fancy homemade Greek yogurt, this is worth getting. I'd come back often for the yogurt, but the salad will be an indulgence when I'm too lazy to put my own together. \n\nThe vibe is great at night. It's a dark dining room, kind of a bar vibe.

The fries could have more garlic and the salad was okay too. The environment is cozy but crowded, but the good thing is you don't feel uncomfortable although it's so crowded. The only thing I didn't like about this place was they charge you to refill the tiny sauce for fries!!! In general it was a good place for having lunch and the price was affordable!",

Even during a quick lunch break I can order take out and not have to scarf it all down. Noshing on the yogurt helps pass time too. Yogurt toppings are tad on the sweet side.\n\nThere is not a single item on this simple menu I would not recommend. Honestly it is hard to not love roasted meats no matter chicken, pork or lamb. Soulva wins at making an interesting salad. It is not simply tossed together with some \"mixed greens\" but also includes fruit, pickled flavors and nuts.

My go to is the veggie salad with lamb. It has white sweet potatoes that are nothing short of spectacular.",

      "text": "Souvla is the combination of so many things I love about food. Greek cuisine paired with fresh ingredients, unique flavor combinations, and quality meat makes for an amazing meal. I had the chicken sandwich, which is essentially a pita wrap, and it was one of the best Greek wraps I've ever had. The pita was toasted perfectly for a slight crunch on the edges, while still chewy and thick. The chicken was taken right off the rotisserie, and the grill flavor paired really well with the fennel and pickled onions. The mizithra cheese and the navel orange slices really pulled it all together, and it added an unexpected twist to the wrap that brought California flavors to traditional Greek food. Their Greek fries were also great, with a good portion of crispy, fat fries that were seasoned and drizzled with a little cheese. Without a doubt, Souvla has become one of my favorite spots in the city!",

      "text": "I particularly like the atmosphere, decoration and location of the place - and this new brunch offering in addition to its famous roast meats only makes it more perfect! Even though the choice is not huge (four meals and four beverages) everything they do is nicely presented, freshly made and simply delicious.\n\nWe chose the lamb sandwich and the greek toast. \n\nThe lamb wrap comes with scrambled eggs, radish, tomato, onion, avogolemono, garlic yogurt and feta cheese. I looked around in the restaurants - the majority of people ordered this dish and everyone was quite obviously very happy about it. \n\nThe greek toast (pieces of crispy sugar and cinnamon dusted pita bread) is served with sour cherry syrup and frozen Greek yogurt - I promise it is the best! Overall, I saw only empty plates going back to the kitchen - and that is always a good sign!\n\nIn comparison to other brunch places in California, the portions served here are relatively small so you can easily pick two dishes if you are very hungry or share three between two people. Prices rank between $9 and $13 and these are totally reasonable.\n\nAlso great about this place is that we only waited for 5 minutes to order and be seated at Souvla on a Saturday morning at 11am, which is really unique in San Francisco. Make sure to check it soon before the crowds hear about it!",

Also their fries look yummy!!\n\nI will def be back :)",

I showed up at Hayes and told them I would just pay here and do a new order. But they took forever to let me do that and after the manager came and finally agreed I was able to order and get food. I called the Divisadero location asking if I could get a refund for my order that I had tried to cancel and they told me it wasn't possible. This is extremely disappointing as I don't think it would cost them a lot to just cancel my order and refund my money. This shows very poor judgment in management. I like the food but I doubt I would go back here again. Such a shame.",

The high bar stool tables, natural lighting, and rotating racks of roasting meat create a bright, soothingly clean atmosphere. You order at the counter and take your number to your table (no waiter service).\n\n- Pork Shoulder \"Sandwich\" ($10): Sandwich = wrap. Also, literally everyone else here ordered a salad and I felt the judgment as my unnecessary carbs arrived, but no regrets! The ingredients are incredibly fresh, and the standouts are actually the vegetable pairings (pickled onions, tomato, cucumber). The wrap itself was fluffy and seemed to be house-made.\n\n- Frozen Greek Yogurt with Baklava Flakes & Syrup ($5): I haven't had much baklava in my life, but the stuff here is delicious! There was just the right amount of syrup to top it off. The yogurt itself was unremarkable. It comes in the iconic \"We are happy to serve you\" Greek paper cup!\n\nSouvla is a trendy spot for lunch in Hayes Valley and definitely worth a try even if you aren't a fan of Greek Food.",

      "text": "This place was surprisingly packed on a Tuesday night around 8pm and surprisingly trendy. I was not expecting that type of ambiance for a Greek restaurant, but I guess it is Hayes Valley after all. The restaurant is small so it's a little difficult to find a table; it's also pretty loud and dimly lit.\n\nI liked that they have a simple menu consisting of 3 different meats (chicken, pork shoulder, lamb) and a veggie option in the form of a \"sandwich\" or salad and sides that include fries with olive oil, lemon juice and cheese, roasted potatoes, and Greek salad. They even have froyo - I really wanted to try the one with baklava crumbles! But I already planned to go to Smitten that night for my ice cream fix haha. I ordered the pork shoulder sandwich, which was delicious! I mean I was STARVING from the gym so that might have been part of the reason I was practically inhaling my food, but I still think it would have been really good. The meat was tender, the sauce was good, it had a perfect amount of cheese, and the bread was so soft. I'd definitely order it again! We also ordered the fries and salad, which were okay. The fries would've been better if the cheese was melted instead of just loose because most of it doesn't stick and ends up falling to the bottom. The salad was good, but had a bit too much olive oil. They also serve wine and beer here!",

I've never been overly fond of lamb but this was the best lamb I have ever had, period. I could not get enough of it and wished they were still taking orders because I would have gotten a second one in a heartbeat.

The yogurt is plain, creamy, smooth, neither bitter nor sour nor sweet. Almost like milk in that way, I suppose. It's delicious. And then that topping. Wow! So amazing. The baklava and honey syrup is very sweet, as you'd expect, but if you can control yourself enough to take little pieces of the topping on your spoon to pair with the yogurt, you'll enjoy a beautifully balanced dessert. I'm curious to try out their other flavors!",

So I was more than excited to try it here on my first visit. it did NOT disappoint. IMO soups like these are every antidote to a chilly or stressful city day. Not that this day was that, beautiful warm and sunny and lunch with my BFF since high school. Just sayin. The salad was ok, I didn't like the meat actually. I think I ordered pork. It was kinda tough and chewy. The juicy potatoes were addictive and the greek bottle of white wine we ordered was fantastic!! and a good white is always a challenge to obtain in my experience. Yay for another great dining option on Hayes. oh and Good service too! Love the little patio out back.",

      "text": "Ok I have to say I was skeptical at first but I really like this place. I am a sucker for lamb. I mean the cuter the animal, the more I want to cook it and serve it in a sandwich. And they do a good lamb shoulder. Tender cuts, deboned and well spiced. All the seasonings are great, nothing over the top (like it's not just covered in mayo or yogurt). I actually enjoyed my meal. Now the part that is sort of my weak spot ... the frozen greek yogurt. So far I have only had the baklava and the olive oil & sea salt. I have to see they are both great combos and depending on the mood decides which I get. Sadly I have been sick so I have been avoiding it. But it's tart and fatty and even though it's cold out I don't give a crap I am gonna have it. I think it's well priced for the area, and it's relatively quick for what it is. \n\nThe people running it are really friendly. Like everyone has a smile on their face and it's like one of those places where you actually see that the people involved actually like working there. Like not just a forced fake smile.\n\nLayout of the place is awesome too. Like the communal table, is a great idea. The outside & inside bar is awesome and nice looking. The only thing that's weird about the layout is ... where to wait to order or for your order. There are two places to order and people walk in and get confused because they are located at the entrance (where the indoor/outdoor bar is) and the other at the other end by the display of rotisserie chickens. I think I know what they are trying to go for, but I think people are not going to figure it out so they all sort of stutter by the entrance trying to figure out what to do.  I know it's new and I am sure they are figuring it out, but I mean so far that's it's only flaw. I am a fan.",

      "text": "Love the concept as greek staples like roasted chicken and lamb, in their traditional Mediterranean preparations, have been been under-represented in the fast casual segment.  Unfortunately, I think the execution at Souvla misses the mark and under-exploits the potential of these foods.  \n\nOn the positive side, the ingredients are high quality, the service is fast (a line extending to the street moved very quickly), and the environment in the restaurant is pleasant.   My wife and collective had the chicken sandwich (essentially, a souvlaki), the \"juicy\" potatoes (prepared under the chicken drippings), and a lamb salad.   The meat was a little dry.  Dry meat and bread is a bad combination in any sandwich.  More critical, I think, was that -- across both the potatoes and the sandwich -- was a missing \"herb-iness\" that is essential to Greek cooking.  The potatoes should have been bursting with oregano and lemon flavor, when in reality it lacked both save for a insubstantial scattering of oregano.  Same with the sandwich.  The chicken should have been rich with a garlicky, lemony, oregano-ized marinade, but it tasted fairly plain.  It's a real lost opportunity as both the meat and potatoes should have been rich in flavor.  Instead, everything was kind of bland.\n\nOverall, the place is a little disappointing and I probably wouldn't return here.",

It's design is simple with a large community table and tables for smaller groups. It is tastefully done and beautiful to look at. It definitely makes you feel like you are in Greece, which is a welcome addition to the many cultural motifs throughout the city. With the exception of Kokkari there aren't many Greek places. As you walk in you'll see the Souvla oven by the front counter. Here is where the magic happens. Chicken, lamb, pork and sweet potatoes make their rounds over an open flame, slowly searing in juices and flavors. All of them are to die for. You get your pick and they are stuffed into a Gyro with amazing sauces and condiments that you won't find anywhere else. \nThe menu is fairly simple but there is beauty in simplicity here. You won't agonize over choices and do not forget to get the Greek fries. They are utterly fantastic.\nSouvla is perfect for the casual diner and even those looking for serious food without the fuss of a more formal restaurant. It's a perfect place to pick up a Gyro for the park close by or a night at home or a fun time in the restaurant. I'll see you there!",

It's dark and bustling at souvla, with a wall of revolving roasting meats dripping their delicious nectar of melted fats as you watch and wish you were one among them in that rotisserie kingdom. Except alive and not a dead hunk of lamb.\n\nHonestly I thought my lamb wrap was kind of dry. It was large, yes, but lamb was mainly too tough, and the rest were fairly standard Greek ingredients. The supposedly famous potatoes were disappointing. Generally just oily, they lacked both unique seasoning and any sort of desired texture beyond fluffy carbohydrates.\n\nMaybe I'll try the Greek yogurt. Good casual place though.",

As usual, I was scanning the screen looking for a place for the perfect gyro. What to you know? Up popped the name Souvla, a brand new Greek restaurant in S.F. Was this meant to be? \n\nNot quite understanding whether or not it had opened yet, I headed over. The Gods of food pointed me in the direction of Hayes Valley. Oh, no. not my lucky day. CLOSED for pre-opening party. Standing at the door, with my tongue hanging out, the owner Charles, welcomed me in to enjoy lunch on him. \n\nI was definitely not disappointed. I tried the lamb gyro. The meat was delicious...succulent and well seasoned, with a mix of crunchy veggies and sauce. The gyro was thick and toasted. A side of the Greek fries and I was hooked. Unfortunately,  it was lunchtime, so I didn't indulge in any of the great wines on the list. However, it would have been the perfect accompaniment. \n\nYes, all the stars were perfectly aligned. All in all, everything about this place is great. Simple and to the point. Hopefully, there will be take out. The perfect grab and go if you don't have time to relax and enjoy.",

Its as though the authenticity bit is just gimmck whereas if it  was carried out in the food, it would be much better. Plus if you get the lamb salad without the fake yogurt they put nothing on it and its like dry old lamb with chard and lettuce and radish without any flavor or anything to bind them.

I can be very indecisive so upon the recommendation of the cashier, I ordered the vegetarian salad with lamb, greek style. Greek style = salad with fries on top. When I got home 30mins later, the fries were still crispy (success!!), and they were quite delicious. The salad was huge, and I saved more than half for lunch the next day. Love the sweetness of the sweet potato and the saltiness of the olives in the salad. Definitely a good balance. Can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu!",

      "text": "I was really bouncing back between giving this place four stars or three stars. But In the end, I always give my ratings based on whether I would come back. Sadly Soulva doesn't succeed with this form of evaluation.\n\nLet's start with the good: the meats that this place cooks are exceptional. I haven't had such tender lamb or pork in a long time. They have a rotisserie in the back so you can see them roasting their chicken which is just as good. This place is also in the hear of Hayes Valley amongst a lot of restaurants and shops so it's one of the better parts of town.\n\nHowever... if you are going to be a place that has a limited menu (w/ high prices!), you really need to make sure said items are exceptional. I got a sandwich and a salad. I am not a big fan of pita to begin with, so maybe this was the issue, but I seriously felt that pita was the only thing I could taste with each bite. I don't why it was so overpowering. Like I said, the meat is delicious so I actually found myself pulling out the meat to enjoy it rather than sacrifice the taste with the pita. The salad was not that much better. The harissa dressing wasn't bad but it wasn't exceptional either. I think the thing that bothered me was the fact that it wasn't really Greek, it was a kale salad with the dressing and then the meat. Granted, this place is more Greek fusion (first place of its kind that I have tried), but still it wasn't too spectacular. The fries also... It seemed like the only thing different than regular fries was the additional of some grated Greek cheese, I mean come on, really? I also tried the soup, which actually wasn't bad, probably the best part of the meal...\n\nMaybe I am just super picky because I have been to some amazing Greek places (see my past reviews) and also this place is more Greek fusion as I said earlier. Unfortunately, this concept needs to be more refined by Soulva, especially if they intend to keep a limited menu... Part of the reason I docked this review down to three stars is because I am already bored.",

The result in this case is delicious, with the Lamb souvlaki and avgolemono soup both winners, albeit at a high Hayes Valley price point, with the lamentable trend towards long lines, counter ordering, after which one must scramble for a seat, elbow to elbow with the luck of the draw. As an ethnic Greek, the real way to enjoy this food is with leisurely stretches camped out at tables for hours while while waiters ply you with inexpensive dish after dish, not cued up and rushed out like at Starbucks, so that's why I've taken off a star, and why I won't be a regular,  but it's still worth a visit for the quality of the food.",

      "text": "So far, everything I have had here had been AMAZING. And given that they pretty much have only three things: a gyro sandwich, a salad, and yogurt, that's saying A LOT!\n\nWith the slightly higher price tag ($10 for salad, $12 for sandwich) that may at first intimidate usual lunch grabbers, the quality of the meat and accessories is totally worth it. For the salad, they give you a HUGE BOWL of lightly dressed kale, lettuce, and assorted fresh vegetables with loads of your choice of meat. I have yet to finish the salad bowl in my past two visits. The sandwich may be on the more moderate side in terms of portion, so if quantity per price is what you are looking for, you could be disappointed.\n\nI was especially pleasantly surprised by their frozen Greek yogurt. Even the most tart frozen yogurt at places like Easy Breezy and Yogurtland are TOO SUGARY for my taste. Not this place! Their frozen yogurt is softer, more watery, much less sugary, and tasted great with my choice topping of sour cherry syrup. \n\nOverall, I am super happy to have discovered Souvla. The salad + yogurt combo is going to have me keep coming back for more!\n\nGood:\n--- juicy, high-quality delicious meat (chicken, pork, lamb) and veggie\n--- HUGE and healthy salad bowl portion\n--- good fries\n--- amazing frozen greek yogurt\n\nPossible bad:\n--- slightly higher $$\n--- sandwich portion not big\n--- line can sometimes be long and confusing",

All of the other ingredients in the sandwich came together to create a good sandwich, but the lamb itself was just ehhh.

We've been to their Hayes Valley and NOPA locations, and though I'd like to say they were both equally consistent, the latter (NOPA) was better, e.g. the actual wrap was softer and not as rigidly thick as Hayes location. The Avgolemono was fantastic at both, and the salad sparkling. We've had the pork shoulder and lamb, and though we love both, prefer the lamb. I love the mix and match options, e.g. you can get any meat as a wrap or on salad--and their salad isn't just a bed of wimpy greens, it's a true greek salad with plump, juicy tasty bursing with flavor red tomatoes, juicy fresh cucumbers and kalamata olives, with feta, and a dressing with miles and miles of will not quit flavor. Their fries come in a charming cup and are perfectly crunchy with just the right amount of soft give, and excellently salted. But the ultimate is their yogurt, which I love with sea salt and honey (my husband loves their baklava crumble). We sat outside in the patio and had such a phenomenal time . . . no wait and quiet. But the Hayes was deafeningly loud, zero acoustics, a a line forever, zero seats, aghh . . . but the food is as solid as anything, with freshly roasted meats--there's no better and fresh 'quick bite' around :-)",

For full disclosure, I'll admit to having a serious love affair with plain tart frozen yogurt, which means I'm practically an expert on the treat. Souvla's does not disappoint. Moreover, their toppings pack an extra punch. Personally, I prefer the honey the best, although the cherry was a close second. Skip the baklava toppings unless you have a massive sweet tooth.",

I liked how it tasted very light yet flavorful. I tried a bit of my date's yogurt with baklava and syrup and it was good but maybe a bit too sweet for me. Good place for dessert!

Boyfriend and I have traveled to Athens and had them for dinner half the time we were there and really miss it!\n\nWe split the lamb wrap, which was very good, but definitely not worth $13+. It wasn't similar at all to the souvlaki we had in Greece, but this was to be expected - we're in SF and this restaurant is way fancier than any of the late night cafes in Athens. The space is airy, light with stylish accents like dried olive branches. Staff was well groomed but a little haughty. \n\nProbably won't be back, there are plenty of other places that would've fed us both for $13+.",

Although, the staff was definitely friendly and both they and the food move fast. \n\nThe food was 4-star. We both had chicken sandwiches, and fries (although would have liked to be told we had to request/pay extra for dipping sauce). I did wish hummus was on the sandwich, or maybe a yougurt sauce. \n\nI felt that the price (28pp with one sandwich and one wine each) was a bit silly for somewhere that I have to fight to sit down and wait to order at a bar. \n\nWant to try the greek froyo next time!",

I'm a huge fan of Mediterranean food and I thought eating it without the lamb/pork wouldn't be as good, but Souvla proved me wrong! I decided to try the lamb my second time around, and I was surprised that it wasn't served hot/fresh, the way I had expected, but since I got it on a salad bed, it was still just as flavorful. I love how they give you a huge bowl for the salad and don't skimp out, and I left feeling full! The ambiance is also nice, with white tables. There are 4-6 seaters on the left side, and individual \"bar\" like seats around the right side and the back (the back seats you can directly see the meat being cut/cooked - kinda cool). The seats in the middle you share, which at first, I thought was cramped, but for dinner, the bustle of the restaurant added to the good experience. Can't help but love this place!",

      "text": "Since it's opened, I've literally walked down the the street twice trying to find it, looking up from my Yelp map to compare it to my surroundings. Yesterday we struck gold. Nestled between Patxi's Pizza and... some random store, is the clean and refreshing white tiled Souvla. Maybe I missed it because of the small sign right above the door, or the crowd of people waiting to get in that obscured my view, but I am glad we did.\n\nFOOD:\n\nDelicious. The menus is small and focused, you essentially pick your protein (or the veg option) and get it as a wrap or salad. I had the pork shoulder, she had the lamb. We both got salads. They were varied and delicious, just the right amount of dressing. The kale to lettuce ratio was a little high, but that's probably a personal preference. The price is a little high when you think about it as a $12 wrap instead though. It's funny how I imagine salads should cost more than sandwiches, but that's the world we live in I guess. \n\nSERVICE: \n\nPretty minimal, you order at the counter and find a seat. Everyone was polite, young, hip. They had really nice aprons? Not much to say one way or another. \n\nENVIRONMENT:\n\nThey've only been open a short time, but it's pretty typical Neu SF: Hip, line out the door, tech elite, fancy casual. Not bad, not good, just how it is. We sat in the indoor window seats, which is pretty nice, but the outdoor window seats face directly in towards you (Sort of like.. sitting on the inside of an \"L\" shaped table, and someone is sitting at the bottom side of the \"L\"). It made it feel a little bit like they were watching us eat, because, they were. A little weird when you have tzatziki sauce running down your chin, but not the worst in the world. \n\nGo, try it. It's a step up (and a $ up) from Hayes & Kebab anyway.",

Veggies were crisp. Chicken was shwarma-y. Awesome ? More \"just good\". The lamb was tasty. Fat was well rendered, the spicing was good. But frankly ? A little over cooked. I am saving the pork for the morning. I got a side of fries, and they were nice and crispy, with a sprinkle of feta. Good. Not great. I don't get what the fuss is about. The food did not live up to the line. It seemed more like a neighborhood joint, and I wouldn't make the trip if there was a shwarma shack nearby. Makes me wonder why SF is so ga-ga over this place. Meh.",

The hotel we usually stay in on Market street has gone up to almost $300 a night forget that. Our friend found us a place to stay on Grove, not $300 a night. \nHoly cow what has happened to the neighborhood. Now filled with many shops and restaurants, and has become quite fashionable. He suggested Souvla.\nFirst, it reminded me of our fave Greek restaurant in paris 60 years ago. Long table with strangers seated next and in front of you, side tables, small seating outside, and everyone having a good time. \nAfter a 10 minute wait, I ordered a lamb sandwich, lamb yoghurt and the fixings, it was very good and enough for two.\nThe 2nd night I ordered a pork sandwich. Back to the hotel, discovered it was a pork salad instead. It had kale in it, not my favorite super popular green, BUT, it turned out to be  the most interesting salad I have ever had. Many chopped greens, and pork, and I simply cannot describe the dressing. Don't know what those tastes were, sweet, tart, not heavy with oil.\nI highly recommend it, but you might ask first what the dressing is. I will tomorrow night when I return.",

The Greek fries were just okay; nothing really stood out to me even though it sounded quite good on the menu - with olive oil and parsley sprinkled on it. The Greek yogurt with baklava crumbles definitely stood out to all of us though - the yogurt was just tart enough to balance with the sweetness of the baklava and syrup to make for an extremely delicious dessert to cap off the meal. It was so good that we came back a couple of weeks later just to order some of the Greek yogurt with baklava after eating dinner at another place. Definitely come here to try one of the their entrees, but also make room for some yogurt!",

The bowl was by far better, with a great dressing and less heavy than the wrap. We also got the garlic fries which were incredible and finally the baklava fro-yo which to our surprise, was not good! We had heard great things but it was very disappointing bc the sweetness of the baklava did not pair well with the tartness of the greek yogurt. It could have if they did something to better integrate ingredients but they just cut up baklava (too sweet) and stick it in the froyo (too tart).",

The lamb had a stronger flavor for those of you who are sensitive to it so it might have been better with a little more yogurt sauce. Chilli sauce at the table was not spicy. Bread was okay, between risen pita and the completely flat wrap kind. I understand that part of its value is free range meat and fresh ingredient which I liked (radish and cucumber in the lamb sandwich). But overall feel it is overhyped.",

      "text": "Wanted to love this Greek sandwich/salad spot in Hayes Valley, but I only wound up liking it (in a \"can we just be friends?\" kind of way).\nDon't get me wrong, it's a cool space in a fun neighborhood, with plenty of attractive hipster clientele. But something just seemed off to me.\n\nMy friend and I both ordered the Lamb Leg Sandwich (Harissa-Spiked Yogurt, Cucumber, Radish, Pickled Red Onion, Feta Cheese), and split an order of the Greek Fries (Olive Oil, Lemon Juice, Oregano, Mizithra Cheese). The sandwich was certainly generous in its portion size. However, it was surprisingly dry and bland. I guess I was expecting a little more burst of exotic flavors and juices (something more along the lines of a shwarma). But all that you could really taste with each bite was the dry lamb and the feta cheese. I kept pouring on the hot sauce just to mix up the flavor pattern. Maybe a few tomatoes and some spicy yogurt sauce would have added to the mix. As for the Greek Fries, they were a bit undercooked and under-seasoned for my taste. Next time, I think I'll order some extra yogurt sauce to dip them in. That being said, for $4 you'd think that they could throw in some sort of dipping sauce at no extra charge. It's like charging a diner for ketchup or aioli. \n\nFor dessert, my friend indulged in the frozen Greek Yogurt (which she loved). \nOver all, the place was fine. The service was friendly, the atmosphere was cozy, the prices are affordable - so I'd definitely give it another shot. Though next time, I think I'll explore the rotisserie chicken and pork shoulder options.",

I work in the neighborhood and there is no cheap lunch/dinner option (dragon eats is the best bet there) but in the Hayes Valley land of $14 dollar salads... Souvla for me reigns supreme. I've had all of their salads, the soup, and the fries and I love them all. They're known for their roasted meats, which are usually fantastic, but not the salad I'm obsessed with. For some reason their vegetarian salad is just the perfect balance for me. Tons of hearty sweet potato, briny olive, tart pickled onion, and crunchy earthy walnut perfectly dressed. At least once a week I come here and order this salad Greek style (the perfect amount of fries for me) and a side of granch to dip my fries into . It's perfect amount for two meals for me. So there it is, at the land of roasted meats I'm obsessed with their veggie salad! Also my wonderful excuse to shamelessly eat some of the best fries ever. Sidenote, I love to put some of their hot sauce in the granch for my fries. Yum.",

But I don't know what people are talking about in their reviews when they mention satisfying portions. I ordered the chicken salad and it arrived barely meeting the halfway point of the bowl.  It definitely did not look like any of the pictures on Yelp. For an item with the word chicken prominently featured, there was very little. What was there was shredded bits scattered around the salad, and even worse was it was super dry and stringy.  Did not seem like a $15 salad and was not filling enough to be a meal. The pork sandwich was also dry and lacked some flavor and sauce.  If this is indicative of other items, I think the meats are being way over cooked. Fries were good.",

There are several 4-person high tables, a large communal table, and some bar seating throughout the space. I would suggest not coming with a large party unless you go early or are prepared to wait. \n\nThe ambience was dim, with holiday lighting and decorations. It reminded me of a bar in lower East side of NYC. Definitely a nice spot for a date.\n\nOnto the food: The menu is pretty straightforward - your choice of meat (chicken, lamb, pork) or veggie in the form of a bowl or wrap, plus some sides. We opted for two lamb wraps and a veggie wrap, plus a side of the fries with garlic yogurt dipping sauce, for around $15 per person total. I thought the lab wrap was great - lots of big pieces of lamb, some cheese, and some pickled onions and cucumbers. We did notice, though, that the lamb sandwich was very oily on the outside: it's wrapped once in foil and then in paper, but you still end up getting some oil on your hands when you eat it. My dinnermate also noted that the wrap was a little light on the veggies for his preference. We ended up skipping dessert (though the Greek froyo looked amazing) - will try it next time. \n\nOverall, a yummy spot for lunch when you're shopping in Hayes Valley or for a casual dinner date. I would definitely come back!",

I always feel like I need another sauce to add it my salad or wrap, even when I get the side of sauce. It helps but I always feel a little disappointed. I do like the option for the area, but it definitely is like a \"healthy fast food\" choice- the Greek version chipotle.",

The frozen yogurt cup is big enough to share (or eat alone, of course) and there was just enough topping for the yogurt to be tart and not too sweet. I really enjoyed the real yogurt taste with honey and some crunch! This treat sets you back about $5.50, but it is well worth it.",

The environment is friendly and the walls are decorated with cool, Greek memories almost as if it were your own friends and family on the walls. \nThe chicken salad was SO good! We also ordered a lamb sandwich but I found the salad and chicken so refreshing and delicious. Totally a place I would go back to and between 3 of us we split two dishes and felt totally satisfied. I even had a to-go bag for leftovers. Good for casual, dining and something that isn't too heavy!",

The french fries were crispy and hot.  I had the lamb sandwich and it delivered, tasty and meaty, a tad high on the salt, even for a sodium aficionado. The salads are generous. The white wine by the glass could be better, but overall it was nice meal and all in our party seemed to enjoy it. Order at the counter and have a seat. The service was quick and attentive.

Not a place to linger.\n\nIt's super crowded but I was able to find a seat quickly. Had the lamb salad and side of Greek potatoes. Salad very good, lettuce, kale, red onions, generous portion meat (but one big piece gristle, ugh), cheese, dressing. Potatoes OTOH were limp, greasy, and lukewarm. Not sure why others recommended them so highly! Sadly, they do not sell hot tea. I quite simply do not consider it a meal without my tea! Greek iced tea was too sweet and iced tea just does not taste like \"real\" tea to me. As addictions go, tea is pretty wimpy but I may have an addiction since I just can't do a meal without it.\n\nStaff very friendly and considering how fast paced quite efficient.\n\nHad frozen yogurt with honey. The cold turned the honey into something the consistency of fudge sauce. Interesting concept I may try at home. \n\nHowever, I went afterwards to Arlequin Cafe for a pot of tea!",

Inside, the menu says Greek this and Greek that, but having been raised on traditional Greek food, the food here was a mystery to me. Not that it wasn't good; it was, especially the moist chicken in the salad. Speaking of, where's the traditional Greek salad? I had the fries, which reminded me of French fries, except with add ons that I couldn't really taste. Basically, the food didn't wow me. And the prices were way too much, especially the salad. Also, the man across from me got pita with his salad. Had I known that was a possibility, I would have ordered that, instead of the fries. I wish the staff had told me about it when I ordered or put it on the menu. If I returned, I might be tempted to get the yogurt, but that's a big if, since I'm lactose intolerant.",

They have glass bottles of water and cups behind where you order, which I really appreciated after walking around in the city.\n\nThey brought all of our food out surprisingly quickly. The order of fries was pretty big, and I was definitely satisfied with just half of it. The fries themselves were also very large, but a bit bland.\n\nThe \"sandwich\" itself was a pita folded in half, filled with meat, onions, goat cheese, and spices, and wrapped in aluminum foil. There was a lot of greasy liquid inside, much of which dripped out through the side that wasn't wrapped shut and made the sandwich a bit difficult to eat. But despite this, the sandwich was excellent overall - the lamb was very tender and filled with flavor, and the other ingredients were mixed throughout the meat nicely.",

I was too hungry to leave the neighborhood without eating, so I stopped in to Souvla. Now, IT'S MY NEW FAVORITE PLACE!  Mmmm. The menu is basic- lamb, chicken,  pork, veg- and you choose one as a salad or a sandwich.  I chose the veg as a salad: white sweet potato,  pickled red onion, walnuts, rasins, pea shoots, lacinato kale (as opposed to lettuce? Yes, please!!), Mitizrah cheese and a yogurt dressing. There wasn't anything I would have changed. It was fantastic. Unreal. My husband had the chicken as a gyro,  which I tasted.  The chicken, which is done on a rotisserie,  was moist and tender. We shared some garlic fries with harrissa yogurt and minted yogurt,  and ended with Greek Frozen Yogurt with crumbled baklava (holy moly!!!). Satisfying,  fredh, delicious.  I will be back!!!",

It's hard to find a place that satisfies both of us, plus my husband.  Souvla to the rescue!  My picky kid had a chicken sandwich that had just bread, chicken and ketchup (phew!).  I had an AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS chicken salad.  The rotisserie chicken is to die for. OMG, it is so incredibly flavorful. My husband is a pretty big critic when it comes to how food is cooked, and he loved it too.  Rich, juicy, delicious.  The salad (mine sans cheese) was crisp, flavorful, and light, but very filling.  The service was excellent.  The food came out at lightening speed.  And they have four separate seating areas:  outside on the sidewalk, inside the front, along the side wall, and an outdoor rear patio section.  I'm already looking forward to my next visit.  One day after I hit my goals, I'll get that awesome looking baklava!",

All the ingredients that came with the sandwich were really fresh but the main event, the lamb, lacked flavor and tasted more boiled compared to the lamb glistening on the spit at the back of the restaurant. My bf had a breakfast lamb sandwich and it barely had any meat in it with the same flavor. The fries were well fried but I'd prefer them plain instead of the flavor they added.\n\nI haven't tried the salads or the other meats but I wouldn't recommend the lamb unless it was just an off day.",

The atmosphere is trendy and great for a date or quick bite to eat - really enjoy everything about this restaurant and am so happy they are in the neighborhood! You can't go wrong with the sandwich or salad selection and I love that you can find a flavor you love and have it either in a salad or a gyro. The salads aren't your average salad, they're a huge portion and are so delicious. I always get the lamb or chicken and if it's a sandwich, I'll add extra kalamata and alwayssss extra feta, on everything, always, because feta is the best thing on earth. The Greek fries are a must and if you have room for dessert, or even if you don't, try a frozen Greek yogurt. The Greek olive oil & flaky sea salt is divine and the baklava crumbles with honey isn't too sweet - definitely worth trying! My review might be a bit biased since I could eat Greek food and feta everyday!",

      "text": "I frequented neighborhood Greek delis back in my Boston and New York days, so I'm bummed they're not easy to find in the SF Bay Area. A gyro sandwich or souvlaki is comfort food to me. When I heard about Souvla I said to myself I have to go there. The place is really nice, modern and clean, and the service is great. Except that I wasn't really crazy about the food. Yelpers who give this place 5 Stars owe it to themselves and to Yelp viewers, especially, to go visit a real Greek deli. To be fair, what I found satisfying was the wine list. Love the Greek rose and the white. I'll probably come back to this place if I'm in the neighborhood, nibble on some fries and enjoy some more of their Greek wines.",

Do yourself a favor and try a falafel wrap deluxe, with tabouli at places like Truly med. (in the mission).

For the lamb sandwich and the roasted potatoes made with the drippings. Also the frozen yoghurt. The sandwich was a pretty decent size and it was heavy. The problem was the lamb in mine was so chalky dry. Like large dried cubes of lamb. Hard to take bites out of cause the meat was tough to chew through. Offered my friend a bite, who has been there a few time, and she said that it was so dry. Disappointed :(. Maybe it was just that day, but it still made me sad. The potatoes were cooked well and a little greasy from the drippings, but that's to be expected and I was good with it. The yoghurt was good. Not a fan of the baklava one. It has this fake cinnamon taste(kinda like hot tamale candy) and turned me off. But the yogurt itself was good! I may not try it again but at least I did.",

The food is very fresh, the veggies taste very farm to table, the service is quick and the staff is friendly. I've had chicken wrap and salad, the mixed veggie salad and the sweet potato fries (I wish I could remember the exact menu names, but you get the idea). The chicken is rotisserie and very flavorful and the salads come in fairly large portions. Oh and the frozen Greek yogurt with a choice of add ins (honey, tart/sweet cherry and, um one other) is a nice touch. This place has gotten crowded quickly and there's often a line at the door. I'm not sure that the table lay out is most efficient for a small place. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the menu is really small.",

      "text": "First thing I noticed about Souvla was the very long line extending from their entry way.  On a positive note, the long line means their food is very popular with the locals! This restaurant is really small so be prepared to just grab-n-go rather than dine-in. There is a park right across the street though so you can sit on the benches or tables there and enjoy your meal. I had the pork wrap which was essentially a gyro but was made burrito-style. I thought it was very flavorful and filling but the price was pretty steep, $11 ($13 for the salad version, wtf?!). I also tried the greek frozen yogurt with baklava topping and that was almost life changing. One cup was $3-4 so I had them split one order in half between two cups (for my sister and I). This ended up being a better idea than we had originally thought because they ended up being very generous with the \"half\" they put in each cup! The baklava topping was very tasty and I was surprised that I liked the yogurt part because I am not generally a fan of greek yogurt. So if you're okay with a 3/4 portion and go with a friend ask them to split an order in half ;) Great way to save money and get more than the usual single order. Another tip is for foodies going just for the yogurt. If you don't plan on ordering anything else, ask someone toward the front of the line if they don't mind ordering for you and give them the $3-4 to cover the cost. Unlike the other items on their menu the yogurt is served right away, whereas you get a number placard and have to wait for your hot food items or salad to be brought out. So if you only want yogurt, save yourself some time by avoiding the long line and see if one of the friendly patrons is willing to help you out! I would probably eat here again if I were in the area, but don't be mistaken, I am still unhappy about how high the prices are.",

I ordered the lamb salad, with all of the traditional flavors you'd expect from Greek food but in a lighter meal. This salad was excellent. Filled with lots of lamb over not just lettuce but kale. Very healthy and filling, this salad had great balance. Adding to the charm of Souvla is the fact they serve Greek wines. After visiting Rhodes 7 years ago, I was delighted to be poured a glass of Retsina, a yummy pine wine that is a traditional Greek drink. While the line can run out the door, don't be discouraged. There is limited seating here and yet somehow a fairly quick turnaround to find a seat. The only reason this wasn't 5 starts for me? It was really loud inside, and I was hoping to have an easier time chatting with my dinner company. All in all, a great meal and environment. Efgharisto, Souvla!",

I'd prefer shredded lamb shoulder. \n\nOverall - a pretty good, healthy-ish option in the Hayes Valley.  I like the choice between a wrap or a salad.  I'll definitely return when in the area.",

A few of the chunks of meat were cartilage. Who wants to eat chunks of cartilage? \"Not I,\" said this eater. Overall the souvlaki was okay, but it was definitely not worth $13.

The pita bread or wrap bread was dry and rather tough to bite off. The pork itself was alright, a bit on the dryer side and towards the end of my sandwich, I found myself picking out bits of meat and only eating the veggies and dry bread.\nNow the fries were great. If I go again, the only thing I would order were the fries. Then I would walk out and eat the main course elsewhere. Anyway. Fries. Amazing. Yes.

But, what really hits it on the is their roasted greek chicken brined with feta cheese. Yeah, and make sure you satisfy you sweet tooth by trying their Greek yogurt topped with baklava, not only it made it to (the 2015 7x7 big list) , but because its heavenly.",

Super salty and lamb texture was weird. The decor is nice but everything is self-service and doesn't warrant the price tag. Frankly, I prefer the delicious $7 gyro (in pita) from Locali in FiDi.",

I swear every time, I have eaten at a restaurant in SF I leave disappointed. The food was so good, that as a joke I said to my husband mid bite, I wanted to come back the following day. The following day, we were out on a excursion and on the way back to our room he says, \"so we are having dinner at Souvla right?\" Hell yes! The first time, he had the chicken sandwich and I had the roasted vegetable salad and for dessert we had the frozen Greek yogurt and baklava; all absolutely delicious. I tried avgolemono for the first time *sigh* looove!! Oh my, seriously, just thinking about this place makes my mouth happy! Service is fast, and efficient, dining area is clean. Overall, the entire eating experience was fantastic. I would fly into SF just to have some soup and baklava and fly back home. Outstanding!!!",

Make it Greek style if you want some more carbs+fat to fill you up... can't go wrong. For $17 it's a steal! \n\nThis particular location isn't nearly as busy as the others so it's our new-go to. Hidden gem. Have already ordered pickup twice this week could totally go for it again! Both times the salads were excellent, TONS of chicken and super fresh.\n\nNow the question is, Souvla again for dinner tonight?",

Also delicious fries!\n\nMy favorites are the lamb and pork salad as well as the frozen yogurts. They have a little bit of everything here. Noticed they have small bites/mezze not featured at other locations. (haven't tried yet)\n\nLove that they are able to accommodate \"no cheese\" and other preferences.",

I ordered the lamb sandwich and it wasn't bad but it wasn't WOW either. I thought the radishes were a bit too bitter in the sandwich and ended up taking them out. I recall wishing I had another sauce on the side to add a bit more flavor to the sandwich. It was packed with lamb and cheese but felt like it was just missing something.",

They had a nice selection that you can just nosh on with a good glass of Greek wine. We had the roasted beet salad, manouri cheese topped with honey, thyme and black pepper, and an extra side of pita bread. This location has a wine bar and plenty of seating, both low and high top tables.  The service was great for a fast casual place. Food came out quickly. We were pretty full and didn't have a chance to order dessert. Will have to come back to try the loukoumades.",

We came in around 6 pm before the crowd. But near 7 pm people were waiting in line. They seemed to be low staffed but the staff on site was so nice and made sure to help us even though it got busy. \n\nOne thing I've noticed not just at this location, is the lessening of our ingredients with the years. The green fries now have sparingly cheese. I think the sauce is an add in, they used to be more generous. \n\nOtherwise can't complain with this location. Not a lot at Dogpatch so another restaurant added is appreciated !",

I got the lamb wrap (as recommended by the cashier), garlic fries with a side of yogurt, and after my meal i got the Greek yogurt + baklava. Def would go here again! Feels like a healthy choice after climbing and working out hahaha. The lamb tastes great, the fries were alright, the greek yogurt dessert was so good!!! Nice and tangy, with a touch of sweetness from the baklava. I forgot to get a picture of my meal, just the yogurt/baklava. \n\nAlso the interior is super cute! Nice vibe :)",

First off it's quite far from downtown but it's easy to get to using muni. \n\nThey have their original menu available that's at the other locations and then they have a meze menu that's specific to the dog patch location. \n\nThe Saganaki was really good. The three dips and octopus had a very fishy after taste which was off putting. Spanakopita was OK but needed more flavor. The three dips were also quite salty. \n\nSouvla had also promoted this new spot being a wine bar with natural wines. No natural wines available and the wine list was very limited. \n\nIf I were to go back, I'd stick with the original menu.",

      "text": "Visited Souvla on a weekday evening for dinner for two, which we ordered to go onsite at the restaurant. Their was a line out of the restaurant when we arrived that took about 10 min to go through. Once you arrive at the counter, you place your order and then you have the option to 1) dine inside; but you have to wait for a table to open up or 2) order to go, which must be taken out of the restaurant. Ordering was efficient and quick, which you place with someone else, and took about 10 min before our food was ready\n\n-  lamb sandwich\n- frozen Greek yogurt - baklava crumbles and honey syrup\n\nThe sandwich/gyro itself was good; the lamb was well cooked and flavorful. It also came topped with cucumber, radish, pickled onion, and feta. We also enjoyed our frozen Greek yogurt a lot but one thing to note is that the flavor we selected is very sweet; definitely from the combination of baklava and honey. We did have to eat this one a bit slowly so we didn't over power our mouth with sweetness.\n\n Definitely a cute restaurant and cool for a hang out or date but def be prairies for possible lines too!",

However it was underwhelming in the meatballs as it didn't taste of anything in that dish.\nThe cheese on the hot mezze menu (forget the name) was served on a sizzling plate. It looked like halloumi but didn't taste like it (it was probably a 3/5).\nThe Greek fries were crispy and flavorful as they are at other locations. And the sour cherry froyo was a perfect balance of sweet and sour. \n\nOverall we're glad to have this open close to us and we'll be back to try more soon!",

Food comes out from the kitchen really quickly ! I think I only waited 5 minutes before my food arrived at my table.\n\nThe chicken in the chicken salad I ordered was super dry. Definitely would recommend another protein. The fries were crunchy and delicious when dipped in the Greek yogurt sauce. If you're not hungry enough for a full meal, the fries are a great snack.\n\nFor $32 excluding tip, this is pretty typical pricing for a meal in San Francisco.",

The fries were good as expected, and the flavor of everything would've been really good if not for the saltiness. The avgolemono soup was filling and unique, and the baklava frozen greek yogurt was perfect as always. They gave us the yogurt in a coffee cup with lid and spoon, which was very convenient for takeout. I'm not really sure how the octopus in olive oil is meant to be eaten because it was also salty, but after I took it home and ate it with rice it was good. I like how the pork salad had a large variety of veggies and toppings. I'd still try this place again in the future to see if it's better, but for now I'll just stick to the yogurt.",

We got the chicken salad, fries, and (of course) the baklava yogurt.\n\nChicken salad was fresh and delicious, with a nice light sauce, and the juiciest and most flavorful chicken I've had in a salad. They really do not skimp out on chicken, and it definitely made the meal feel worth the price! \n\nFries were thick cut and crispy, and eating fries as a side to a salad is always a guilt free and fun pairing.\n\nYogurt was also so good! The yogurt is tart on it's on it's own, so the balance with the sweet baklava was really nice. I've heard good things about the cherry one too, but generally that is more for palates that enjoy tart and sour tastes.\n\nWill definitely be back!",

It's also the largest of them all and they have a full bar, as well as small dishes (mezes) that the other locations don't have. I just returned from Greece and already miss the simple yet flavorful Mediterranean dishes so I'll definitely be here often.

The pork was def the highlight, they didn't shy on portions and it was so juicy. But the flavors of the greek yogurt, pickled onion, tomato, etc just weren't jiving. I wish there was more seasoning and freshness. The sandwich was pretty small too, I've paid much less for a bigger sandwich. \n\n3/5: it's healthy, easy, and a nice place to hang out but I wouldn't come back for a meal considering the prices.

We have been eyeing this spot while it has been under construction and were very excited to visit for its grand opening this week! This Souvla took over a former brewery and has ample space for seating and noshing with friends. Unlike other Souvlas, this location has an unique mezze menu with cold and warm dishes. \nWe tried the three spreads, plant based \"lamb\" meatballs, fries, spanokopita, pork salad, lamb pita and baclava frozen green yogurt.\nThe highlights- beautiful & friendly ambiance, many vegan options for our dinner mate, the baclava frozen greek yogurt, spreads, pork salad,\nThe complaints- the lamb in my pita was a little on the dry side, smallish portions for some of the mezze dishes. Also call me basic but I really wished that 2 of the spreads could have been hummus and baba ganoush as only one of the spread was vegan so my friend couldn't enjoy it much. \nDefinitely will be coming back for more, as I'm still dreaming about the Greek yogurt!",

This time around my party order the octopus salad and the saganaki. The octopus salad was really tasty! The octopus was super tender and had the right amount of acidity with the dressing. The saganaki was really tasty as well! My suggestion is that you eat the cheese right away since it gets hard once you've left it sit for a while. Overall, you know what you get when you come here (if you've been to the other Souvla locations)!",

For example, today they forget salad dressing in my to go order, and by the time I realized, it was too late to do anything about it since I was already home. Every salad should come with dressing as default and I don't understand how they forgot to include it. \n\nOn another occasion, I pre-ordered soft serve and was asked to pick it up later, but when I picked it up 1.5 hours later, I was met with resistance and told they would only allow it this one time since it was too late. I don't understand why they allow pre order if we already paid for it and it was well below closing time (3 p.m.).",

Parking is tough around here so quick pick-ups are essential. Otherwise I would give the place a solid 4 star. Hopefully they work the kinks out for pick-ups soon.",

      "text": "Woohoo another Souvla location that opened up in SF and in my neighborhood too! I've previously ordered delivery or take out from their other locations. Ordered at the counter at 6:38pm and my food started to come out at 6:45pm! That is speedy service! Ordered the lamb salad, fries and yogurt to share with my partner. It was a filling meal. The fries were crispy and starchy. The salad had so many things in it! It had lettuce, baby kale, radish, both small and big pieces of lamb, micro greens, cheese, dressing, pickled red onions, and mini cucumbers. It was delicious! The lamb was not dry and it had great flavor. The sour cherry Greek yogurt was a nice treat to finish off the meal. Make sure you dig all the way to the bottom where most of the sour cherry syrup is. The employees were hard at work. They were willing to take your order, were fast to sweep the floor and clear tables and even thanked us for coming. It's rare these days to receive this kind of service when it's not a fine dining restaurant.",

      "text": "Wildly disappointing. Let me preface this by saying that I've long been a fan of the Divisadero location and was looking forward to the opening of the Dogpatch spot. They don't even feel like the same establishment. Whenever I've gone to the Divis location I've felt like I paid a reasonable amount for what I was being served. At this location I felt like I was getting greasy fast food under the guise of sit down service, along with overpriced mediocre wine. What made the wine part even more of a joke is that all of the marketing for the new location suggested a focus on greek wines and that it would be more similar to a wine bar -- the woman behind the bar couldn't even understand what wine I was asking for much less answer any of my questions about it. \n\nAs far as the food goes, skip the rotisserie chicken. I don't understand how something could be simultaneously so dry and so greasy? Also the new menu items aren't at all worth it and they would have done better to focus on executing very few menu items well using high quality ingredients (like how they used to do before opening a ghost kitchen for delivery orders and making airplane food). \n\nThe location was the only thing about the experience that felt nice, but not so much that the cost felt remotely justified. We wound up feeling so ripped off by the experience that we now use it as a measure of whether or not a place is worth the money.  Don't waste your money here.",

The food is excellent as always. The lamb salad was succulent and was enough to share among 2. We got an order of fries to share and it was enough for a light dinner.  The Kennebec fried were crunchy outside and creamy inside. The best fries sound! Gender neutral bathroom was clean and well maintained. Service was prompt and courteous. Oh and the yogurt is still delectable! Def coming back here again!",

I lost my appetite after I took the first bite, tasted a ton of oil and saw my hand drenched in it. I've never had food like this. I will say that the soup was delicious along with the pita bread.

I always get the chicken salad greek style. 10/10.\nUnfortunately today I went to pick up my online order and the lady working the register was extremely rude. Every time I come the employees are amazing but this specific employee was really rude. First, I waited at the counter for awhile for her to acknowledge me and when she did, she gave me my order which I responded with thank you and she didn't care at all. She didn't even look at me or nothing, just tossed the bag on the counter. I then asked if I could get forks because they always give me them without asking so I had no idea there was a charge for it. She tossed them in my bag and rudely said \"for future references you have to pay\" which I respect but she just had the most nasty attitude towards me. I would've paid as well at that moment, that wasn't the problem. I felt so uncomfortable I took the utensils out of my bag and gave it back to her. I understand people have bad days but I literally barely even talked nor was I rude AT ALL and she was giving me the worse customer service. I let her know she was being very rude once I left. I never do negative yelp reviews but I was really upset with the way she was towards me.",

Thankfully I was in the neighborhood and it was late in the day where I knew there wouldn't be much of a lunch crowd. \n\nOrdered the lamb salad, greek fries, and honey Greek yogurt. You can order for dine in or to go and it's self seating. There's also a really nice outdoor seating area if you prefer to sit outside. \n\nService was pretty quick. Got my food 5-10 minutes after I ordered. And if you order the greek yogurt you can get it after your meal. \n\nLamb Salad - definitely hearty, I think the dressing could have been a little more watery to balance out the dryness of the lamb; the greens were refreshing (especially since it was a warm day)\n\nGreek fries - came out piping hot with a side of ketchup. You could also upgrade it with other sauces but the fries were good enough on its own. \n\nGreek Yogurt - the MVP of the meal; super refreshing and light, exactly how I imagined frozen yogurt to taste like and the honey drizzle lent a nice sweetness to the tart yogurt \n\nDefinitely will consider trying the sandwich/wrap next time and maybe the chicken or pork.",

The olive oil and flaky salt is my go-to and it might sound a bit weird but don't question it. I wouldn't say it's for everyone but i think they really compliment each other. It's also a pretty light dessert even though it's all dairy and is super refreshing even after a heavy dinner. I also recommend any of the other toppings or even plain. I've been to a few locations and they all have cute but small interiors with limited seating. Service is good and fast.",

It's the perfect dessert, and it's light enough that you can still feel good after devouring it all. I meant to take a picture before I started eating it, but couldn't hold myself back. The baklava crumbles and honey are a perfect complement to the greek yogurt. One day I'll branch out and try another topping, but for now the baklava is too delicious to not to get it every time.",

I'm pretty particular about my mediterranean sandwiches. I wish that they had a falafel sandwich option, but they only had the roasted white sweet potato. It isn't wrapped super well since it all manages to fall apart as you eat it. Sandwich also is rather dry since there's no hummus or sauce. Not my fave unfortunately, but I did like the frozen greek yogurt with baklava crumbles! Very refreshing, tarte, and light -- complimentary to the pistachio baklava and the sweetness of the honey syrup.\n\nAgain, I'm not a huge fan, but maybe I need to try their other protein options? Not sure.",

The food came fast but it did not live up to my expectations like it had before. \n\nItems ordered: \n\n~Chicken Sandwich: The Sandwich in general was dry. It could use less chicken and more Greek salad including tomatoes and cucumbers. All I could taste in a bite was the dry chicken. I wish it had more sauce or yogurt. \n\n~Lamb Sandwich: This had too much meat and little salad. It had way too much radish. The lamb was dry and unseasoned to our liking. \n\n~Pork Sandwich: Pork was a little dry, but the salad to meat ratio was good. It could've used a little more sauce. This was the best one out of the three! \n\n~The stars of the show were the sides including juicy potatoes, side salad, and Greek fries. We were a group of three and easily finished the sided before our sandwiches. \n\nDisappointed ngl as I was bringing my friends here to a place I had once liked a lot.",

I personally liked the Baklava Crumble & Honey Syrup one since the baklava gave it a crunchy texture (like granola). My mom loved the Greek Olive Oil & Flaky Sea Salt flavor though and thought it was really unique and different. \n\nLooking forward to coming back to try their salads and savory foods!",

I would opt for the salad next time for ease of consumption! The portion size is generous. \n\nThe Baklava Crumbles and Honey Syrup Frozen Yogurt was my favorite. Semi-sweet frozen yogurt, it has the zesty flavor of Greek yogurt but the consistency and texture of frozen yogurt. The baklava crumbles are sweet and jam-packed with flavor, and complement the Greek yogurt well. Pairs nicely with Greek fries to satiate a sweet and salty craving.",

      "text": "Tried two kinds of their frozen Greek yogurt:\n\nFirst, let's talk about the yogurt itself: unlike traditional Greek yogurt which tends to be incredibly sour and thick in its original form, their plain yogurt is a bit more thin and weak in taste - which makes them easier to eat in my opinion. Their yogurt has the smell of lactic acid bacteria fermentation, but the flavor of the milk itself is barely noticeable. In other words, it is a little bit \"boring \" when we were only tasting the yogurt without adding other things to it. If you are someone who is looking for your \"traditional\" Greek yogurt experience, there is a chance that you'll be disappointed.\n\nWildflower honey Greek yogurt: at the first few tried, the combination tasted pretty good because the honey adds a special taste to the yogurt. The honey has the right level of sweetness which my friend and I both like, but we both think the scent of wildflowers couldn't be tasted. Something that we don't appreciate about the honey is it quickly sticks together into pieces (probably because the yogurt was too cold) and can't be mixed with the yogurt anymore. So if you get the wildflower one, make sure you stir them up quickly!\n\nbaklava crumbles with honey Greek yogurt : the server forgot to gave us honey that day, but we didn't mind and just went with it. The crumbles is surprisingly a better combination with the yogurt because it adds more layers to the yogurt and makes it flavorful. The scrambles has a cinnamon flavor so it's a good news to those who like cinnamon. I personally am not a fan of cinnamon but I actually like it.\n\nOverall, a healthy option for breakfast and light afternoon snack.",

For the chicken wrap, there's bits of orange in there to help change up the flavors. Also, def get fries!!!! TIP: Pour the fries out onto the tray right away so every fry stays crunchy! \n\nDESSERT: Save room in your tummy for the froyo! Or just make room for froyo, it's worth it. My favorite is the baklava + honey or the cherry syrup. \n\nSERVICE: Employees are quick. Order at the counter and they'll give you a number. Sit anywhere you like indoors/outdoors.\n\nPARKING: difficult to find depending on time of day. There's a lot near by but mostly just street parking. Best if you walk/Uber.",

Outside the shop are various signs with Greek and English inscriptions, all with the classic blue and white color scheme. There is both indoor and outside patio dining available with high and low top tables (Note you must have your vaccination card to sit indoors at restaurants in SF). As well as a to-go window for pick up from the outside. I loved the water spicket and bowls they had out front for our doggies! So sweet! \n\nThe staff are so friendly and kind, and the service is really fast!\n\nI had the pork souvlaki sandwich was good, I think the pork was a little more of a tough texture than I was expecting, but it was still delicious! I might try the chicken next time. The sandwich itself was amazing. A large portion filled with meat, tomatoes, cucumber, feta, and their mint sauce. SO GOOD!\n\nThe mint yogurt sauce they have is their own made in house version of tzaziki sauce. I thought it was super yummy! \n\nMy friend got the baklava yogurt and loved it. The Greek fries were amazing as well! We put some in our pita sandwich :) \n\nDefinitely a great shop and we will be back again!",

I did not want to bring it to yelp, but the poor customer service and follow up was also disappointing. I ordered my usual chicken salad here the other week Togo via DoorDash and picked it up. When I got home to enjoy my salad, I  was not pleasantly surprised to find a bug in the lettuce and a piece of BROKEN PLASTIC mixed in. when I initially encountered the bug, I tried to contact the restaurant and called 3x but no one answered. Then I found the plastic and was disgusted so I tried to call them again with no response. I ended up going down to the restaurant and showed them the object in the food and asked for a refund. They said to email them and took my info and that someone would contact me. NO ONE FROM SOUVLA EVER contacted me about this. Thankfully, I ordered my food via door dash and contacted them. They were awesome and promptly apologized and said they would investigate this further. They also refunded me. \n\nToo bad I really liked this place, but sadly will never eat there again because I am absolutely disgusted at the lack of health, safety, and cleanliness of this place. Not to mention the lack of follow up regarding a matter of food safety.",

I really enjoyed the fast-fine dining experience here. As vegetarians, we shared the VEG sandwich + fries + baklava greek yogurt. (A perk was that they were able to cleanly cut the sandwich in half for us!) We also each got what we thought would be a glass of wine, but ended up being 1/3 of a bottle, served in a really cute copper mug. All of the food was super good. I loved that the veg option was sweet potato, as opposed to the standard falafel. I also loved the harissa-yogurt dip we got for the fries. Of course, the star of the show was the frozen greek yogurt, topped with honey and a huge hunk of baklava. We are definitely going to return here just for that!\n\nWe did have a little sticker shock (our meal came to $55 before tip) but it made sense considering how much wine we got. The portion sizes were also pretty big for the city-- a single sandwich fed me and my fiancee, and we had leftover fries-- so we do feel like it was a pretty good bang for your buck, relative to SF prices. This particular location is super convenient to Marin also. It took us less than 20 minutes to get there from Tiburon!",

Fresh ingredients, perfectly cooked juicy meat, and great seasoning brings their food together. \n\nWe got the lamb salad (meat was super juicy) and there was plenty of feta and the perfect amount of dressing - it was a very refreshing meal for lunch and perfectly filling. We also got some greek fries which were wonderfully crispy with lots of oregano and parsley - a little hot sauce made them perfect.\n\nOverall would say Souvla lives up to the hype as a go-to lunch spot. Can't wait to try the frozen yogurt next time!",

They have an interesting take on mediterranean salad, not just your standard tomatoes and cucumbers ( which I love and could eat daily, but not enough to call it a meal). The Souvla salads are a meal. They have a mix of kale and lettuce, meat, a bit a citrus, herbs and a lovely dressing perfect to sop up with the fries. The flavors are perfectly balanced. \n\nThe food is fast, fresh and feels like it's healthy. \n\nWhenever I am looking for a fast, healthy meal after the gym I love to stop by here and grab a chicken salad. Sometimes add fries, which are delicious. \n\nAlso the frozen greek yogurt with baklava is fantastic and I crave it often.",

My go to is always the lamb salad, Greek fries, and the yogurt with baklava. Everyone has to try their yogurt with baklava it's really something out of this world! The quality of food is just wonderful, always fresh and light. Meat is always juicy and everything is full of flavor. Whenever I'm feeling like a salad i either go to souvla or to blue barn.",

The garlic fries were good & I reheated them in my oven for a bit more crispness since I was a little late to pick up my order since I was running another errand.

Overall the FroYo was a 5/5 but my meal was a 3/5. Prices are  high - salad is close to $20 - but quantity is also generous  so might be a wash.\n\nThe FroYo deserves a spot on every SF dessert bucket list - hands down the crown jewel of Souvla. It is unlike any \"natural\" flavor I have tasted -  very fresh, creamy, and what I imagine to eat while strolling through a Turkish village. It is filled to the brim in a large cup. I got the wildflower syrup which is so sweet that it foils nicely against yogurts pungent tang. \n\nThe salad has visual appeal  -- a gram worthy preparation - greens topped with juicy radishes, micro green, and cheese. My issue fell to taste. The dressing had no salt or acidity to cut through a dense bed of  bitter kale. I was able to resuscitate it with a heavy hand of Tapatio and salt. The \"greek\" fries were nothing special, thick cut and crispy, but non descript flavor. \n\nMy rec is that the chefs go back to test kitchen to reinvent a more yummy salad/dressing combo. Souvla already has a solid base - stronger flavor profiles would make it SO much better!",

The sweetness and consistency reminded me of Beijing yogurt, which is one of my fav things ever! The base was soft and creamy without being too tart (far less tart than say Fage but not as sweet as most froyo options). The baklava crumbles topped the treat along with honey and were a very special take on granola. I found the chunks of baklava to be super sweet but they nonetheless complemented the yogurt.

I've given this place a couple tries as Greek fast food, and I've only had one good meal.  \nThe Greek fries have a couple specks of feta, the meat in the wraps has a lot of gristle and really grossed me out. I ended up picking the majority of meat out of the wrap because every bite was chewing on a piece of seared rubber. The wrap itself was also very dry and stale. I did have one really great wrap that lives in my memory and kept me coming back, but it's been 1/5 tries that have been good. Fool me twice Souvla, shame on me, fool me 4x... I'm still a fool :(",

The potatoes are average and actually too greasy. The avgolemono soup was new to me and I have never had it. It was a smaller serving. It had chicken, rice, egg stock, chicken broth..and it was good, but completely new to me. These were sides at Souvla. It's a small space, but not too crowded.\n\nThen I had some time at Crunch on Chestnut and it was a nice San Francisco day. I walked around the street and took the bus all the way home.",

Don't forget to make your salad \"greek style\". They add fries to your order for a dollar. You don't get as much as the order itself, but it does the trick. This way I won't get too fat. \n\nAnd the \"GREEK YOGURT\" is amazing. Tart and smooth, the way I like it. I prefer it with bakala crumbles, YUM! Can you open one in Russian Hill/Cow Hollow. I need more of you in my life.\n\n4 star instead of 5 is because, they messed up my togo orders. But it's okay. Mistakes happen.",

      "text": "Opening Day today! Being very familiar with the Souvla brand, I had to step inside and grab a bite.  Souvla is a super popular Greek eatery with locations on Valencia, Hayes, Diviz, and now on Chestnut, in the heart of the beautiful Marina neighborhood. \n\nI've been to all their locations, and the most appealing aspect is the nice modern interior.  This spot in the Marina is a comfortable and pleasant place to grab a quick and casual bite.   No table service, just order at the counter, and they'll bring the food to your table.  Although this branch is very small, it is cozy, with a nice Marina neighborhood clientele. \n\nI wish I could say that the food is their most appealing aspect, but it's just average.  The price, though is higher than you'd expect for what you actually get.  \n\nThis time, I got the Lamb Wrap ($14.00 pretax, $15.00+ with tax).  It's served with chunks of spit roasted lamb, but the pieces in my wrap were either overly fatty or super dry.  The good news is that if you eat inside, you can douse your wrap with the delicious hot sauce on the table.  Personally, I'd rather just have moist meat with plenty of yogurt sauce.  It came with some yogurt sauce, but it was very sparse.  The highlight, though, was the fresh and warm pita bread, with a lightly browned bottom.  \n\nTheir spit roasted meats are a nice change, but they always seem to veer on the drier side.  The dryness of their meats is especially noticeable when you order their salads.  In addition to the dry chunks of meat, the portion of meat served on their salads are very skimpy, given the prices they charge.  The salad ingredients, though, are very fresh.  That said, I have no doubt that folks in the Marina would easily pay $18.00 for these wraps, without question.  \n\nAll said, it's still a great addition to the Marina, and it's a neighborhood where Souvla should thrive.",

I was in the area for Soul Cycle, and googled Souvla, and it popped up! I was so excited, and ended up walking there.\n\nThe service was mighty fast; before I paid, my greek yogurt was ready! \n\nFrozen Greek Yogurt with Baklava & Honey ($5): GET THIS ONE! There wasn't much honey, but I didn't mind. I literally eat greek yogurt everyday for breakfast, so it's about time I tried its frozen counterpart. It had that slight tartness to it, and the baklava was chewy and sticky which went well with the smooth yogurt-opposites attract! They give you a good amount of baklava, and I made sure to distribute it while eating the yogurt (taking a small piece of it and then scooping some yogurt onto the spoon), so I could savor both as long as possible. NGL, the consistency of the baklava reminded me of pecan pie, and it was missing the flaky phyllo dough aspect.\n\nThis is perfect for a hot day, or a healthier dessert/snack alternative to ice cream! \n\nNext time I have to try their food because Mediterranean is one of my favorite cuisines.",

      "text": "What I love about a four item menu is there is no room for filler or compromise. I had the lamb leg in salad form. Maybe I still chose badly despite having almost no choice. Maybe the other three Souvla mains are great, and I got the one bad, poorly cooked one. If so, I will be missing out forever on whatever it is City-dwellers love about this chain, because I am not returning. \n\nThe most crucial flaw was the lamb itself. It was well done. Actually, it was overly done to the point of a dozen or so bites being tough and jerky-like. But, even the fact that lamb would be well-done AT ALL when I did not ask for it, caught me by surprise. Who prefers lamb this way, and who expects it by default? Not I. It barely tastes like lamb. All the scary, raunchy, borderline-funky meat smells were absent, and at that point I don't understand what I'm creating such a huge carbon footprint for when I could be eating any other protein. Perhaps drying out the lamb makes sense for Souvla's gyro, but it spoiled my salad from the first bite.\n\nBut, at least this made what might be a hard review easier.\n\nThere were so many missteps in this dish - I'll name them below - but even so, this could have been a difficult and nuanced review in light of the lamb bowl's good price. The price is good because you receive two meal's worth of (for lack of a less-cliched word) fresh food: decent quality but not highly flavorful veggies, presumably made-in-shop-dressing, and supposedly choice bits of lamb - though, what the condition of this cute hunk of meat was before it was cooked into a near-jerky state is only a guess, now - at not much more than it would cost to enjoy two \"power bowls\" of highly processed and preserved (but really delicious) food from Taco Bell.\n\nBut then, it's worth questioning why Souvla forces\nher patrons to buy two meal's worth of food in the first place. This portion is just too big. I came at 4pm, following: 8 hours of sleep, a 9am wake-up, a workout, a small brunch, and nothing else - yet, this was twice the food that I needed. Souvla should offer a half-bowl.\n\nBut setting aside the nuanced price/portion question, this bowl was a disaster. There were no powerful flavors. The sour notes (from the pickled onion; there are no olives) and pungent notes were all toned down to offensively inoffensive levels. This was Greek, neutered and Americanized, then retroactively dressed up with a halo of fine-food sourcing, to arrive at a California-immigrant cuisine that wouldn't make sense to any actual immigrant. Don't strap a helmet on my lamb. Don't put a seat belt on my cheese. I want to be smothered in funk and fat and dead animal. I want my food to be hideous and make me worry I'm going to die, even if it's a salad. Souvla's salad was rife with \"health food\"-ish compromises. The dish is JUST NOT FAT ENOUGH.\n\nNote especially the heavy greens at the bottom: doused with yogurt to mask their fiber (at first\nglance, I thought the greens were cooked within some sort of sour cream, for pungency - but no, they are fresh and bland), thus neutralizing the delicious yogurt, AND squandering the opportunity to put something from the veggie kingdom with actual flavor in that place. Then the feta: when dispersed over a base of lettuce, it goes from being a bold note of tang accenting fat to a sober replacement (in the logic of a health-food-bowl) for more dangerous alternate fats. The feta becomes utilitarian. It should be raunchy and wild.\n\nThe only element on which Souvla's lamb salad succeeded, was the delight I felt in combining the protein and tiny available streaks of fat with the crispy texture of lettuce. This is what one looks for in a protein-based bowl, as opposed to a wrap, and the lamb salad occasionally hit that craving. But, I can get the same bite-pleasure from a Taco Bell bowl, with stronger, far more diverse flavors. That's... really sad.",

      "text": "Souvla is a Mediterranean restaurant, specializing in salads, wraps, and frozen yogurts. I Came here on a Tuesday night 7:00pm and it was quite busy... but the table turnaround time is pretty quick. \n\nI ordered the chicken salad and thought it was pretty good! I liked the ingredients inside the salad: oranges, onions, kale, lettuce, and a few other things. The sauce which is a mixture of their take on a yogurt ranch dressing with an olive oil dressing. I wish I had gotten the dressings on the side and mixed it in myself because they put so much dressing that my salad was pretty much drenched in it and the flavor of the dressing was overpowering the fresh taste of the salad. \n\nThe frozen yogurt here is amazing. I was struggling to decide between two flavors so the server let me combine two flavors in one. So I got the Baklava and cherry flavors. The two went really well together in my opinion... and I will probably be back for more! The frozen yogurt itself is really light and slightly tart, making it the perfect post dessert snack. \n\nInterior: this new location is pretty small with very limited seating. So if you are coming for a special location, I recommend checking out their other locations for a more intimate setting. \n\nService: fits order, then sit down. The workers were very friendly!",

      "text": "Finally , some solid food options on Chestnut!\n\nI've been to Souvla a few times since they opened. I've gotten the chicken salad which is delicious! I just wish I got the fries to go with it (definitely next time... though I'm hoping they're worth the $5 they're charging).\n\nWhat keeps me coming back is the frozen yogurt! Because I'm gluten free, I haven't gotten the baklava one.... it looks amazing though! However, I've gotten the frozen yogurt with olive oil and salt and loved it.  The only thing is I wish they would layer the olive oil and salt so I have more opportunities to get both flavors through out my yogurt.\n\nAlso, there is seating, but not a ton so just beware if you come here during lunch on the weekends.",

      "text": "It Was Better When They Used to Care....\nIt has been 6+ months since Souvla opened in the Marina and I can see the quality slipping on all fronts, but most of all, the food.  \n\nI ordered the Lamb gyro, which was dry and completely vapid of flavor due to the completely overcooked lamb, lack of harissa yogurt sauce and bland pita.  I have had so much better in the past, but the past two visits have been pretty much the same.  \n\nMy girlfriend also complained that the sweet potato was completely undercooked and the salad was also very dry...she had to get two orders of dressing in order to try and remedy the situation.  \n\nThe french fries were once again cold...this has happened many times.  Additionally, when a server brings you fries, you would expect them to bring ketchup or some type of dipping sauce...especially when you are paying $5 for what is a medium-sized order of fries.  \n\nFinally, the white wine at $12 a glass is worse than the $3 buck Chuck at Trader Joes....overly sweet and no balance.  I don't expect much at that price, but you expect something palatable.  \n\nAll in all, I would expect more from a San Francisco-based chain restaurant and with all of the options in the neighborhood, I am no longer going to risk going back to Souvla for yet again another sub-par meal.  \n\nI long for the days when more care was put into the meal....",

I literally have never ordered anything else from this restaurant except the various Greek frozen yogurt flavors. They are divine. I like Baclava the most. The wildflower honey is good, but it's cheaper to buy it plain and just take it home with you and add your own honey (which also prevents the honey from freezing and getting firm on the walk home).\n\nThe servers are really fast and polite. There's a doggy bowl of water right out front. The establishment is great all things considered. But if you're looking for a review of the food, I unfortunately can't help you. But if you're looking for a review of the Greek frozen yogurt. I can tell you after several dozen experiences, that has never disappointed",

When I've eaten here at lunch time, or before 4, it's been better than when I've gone later. I have officially eaten here enough to notice that their chicken is much saltier later in the day. It probably has to do with how they prepare it. It also seems juicier later too. Maybe the juice from the cooking process soaks in more? Some people might really like that though. I know broth is a thing. \n\nAnother tip - side of sweet potato is so delicious! It's literally just a few slices of sweet potato, but it is very good.\n\nEveryone that works there is amazing.

I couldn't believe this to I went to the window and there was only one person attending the line and yes these were all people who placed orders online. This line barely moved I waited in line in the cold for 20 minutes and gave up. By the time I would have gotten to the front of the line my meal would have been cold. Terrible comeback for Souvla.",

I feel so sad I'm in LA for the next couple months and moving to the UK - I will MISS THIS SALAD!",

I was really excited to try their lamb pita sandwich again and my all time favorite the Avgolemono soup! I was disappointed for two reasons: the shoddy, poor quality of the lamb pita and they have increased their prices by $1... including an extra charge for eating utensils! The lamb pita sandwich is now $15! It was cold and thrown together in the takeout box with absolutely NO harissa-spiked yoghurt and a very stingy sprinkling of olive oil and feta cheese. I absolutely won't be going back to Souvla ever again!",

They charged me accordingly for the spoon and I waited for my order which they said would be out shortly. I picked up two orders one to drop off to a relative. I tried the soup before leaving in the car and immediately noticed that it didn't taste of any lemon as it usually does it's as if the lemon was missing. I return to the counter to ask if there was any extra lemons, they said no we don't have lemons I thought that is odd because how do you even make anything in a Greek restaurant without having lemons?! Especially Avgolemono soup!!! It's supposed to have a lot of lemon juice. Maybe they were out because it was so busy but to not have any sliced or preserved lemons or put enough lemon in the soup - just NO. The cashier then tried to offer me some sort of oil dressing that he claimed had lemon in it and after tasting it it was not it was purely like olive oil and herbs it had even less of a taste of lemon than the soup. He acted like I was claiming something false at first and then as if to shoo me away (girl bye) said I'll make a note of it. I've had the soup on multiple occasions at multiple locations. Even the last time I was there for the review I wrote previous the soup tasted completely different and was on point actually the way it should be full of lemon and rice which is another point I'd like to make is that there was zero rice in the soup it was mostly a bland oily broth with some chicken. \n\nI don't know maybe I'm just having bad luck with this location and should just keep going to the Hayes Valley one where I always used to frequent I just started going to the marina one because I thought it would be less crowded and easier to find parking. At least they offered me to \"purchase\" the spoon before leaving. \n\nMoral of the story is AVGOLEMONO Soup must have lotsa LEMON juice.  Get it together Marina Souvla!",

My peanut allergy prevented me from getting the Baklava Crumbles on my yogurt, but based on the reactions of my two friends I feel like that flavor is definitely the one worth getting. I ordered the Cretan Wildflower Honey, which was their greek yogurt with a fresh honey drizzle on top. I wish they added the toppings in layers, because once I ate the honey layer off the top, there was only plain greek yogurt at the bottom. Still, their greek yogurt is rich and delicious, and you get tons of ice cream for the price ($5).",

In a fantastic neighborhood although hard to park totally worth getting there.\nFirst of all, the place is small but very well designed. The order desk was very friendly and efficient. We asked for a couple of suggestions and were well directed.\nThe stars of the show are the succulent meats turning on the rotisserie. We chose the lamb and the chicken both in perfectly toasted pita and the toppings made the whole thing very delicious. It has the right proportion of soft and comforting and crisp and tart. I totally recommend a few dashes of the house hot sauce. Our favorite was the chicken with the orange segments, great combination.\nWe also loved the Greek fries with \"granch\" dressing. The house rose topped it all off.\nWe felt the quality and preparation of the food along with the friendly service made the whole experience a great value. Next time you feel like the best Greek pita, this is the place.",

It didn't really have too much seating (I believe they designed this location with a take-out focus in mind) but we didn't feel too cramped once we sat down. We sat on the \"patio\" (which was more like a couple high top copper tables out on the sidewalk with doors opened to the main seating area) with our number and waited about 15 minutes for our food. If you order the greek fro-yo they give you a ticket so you can pick it up after your meal. The rotisserie can be seen from the dining area so you have a quick peek of what's to come.\n\nFood: We wanted to sample a little of everything so we got:\n\nPork wrap - 4/5 according to the starving boyfriend. Nice little bit of everything in there and a huge portion. Pork was on point.\nChicken salad - 5/5 Now, I'm not a huge salad fan, but I wanted to see for myself what everyone was raving about. I get it now. Massive serving, not overly doused with dressing, good balance of veggies and protein, flavor was there. What put this one over the top for me was the humongous layer of pulled chicken in the middle of the bowl. No dainty cubes of sad boiled chicken breast here. Texture of the chicken varied from nice and soft to slightly crispy for the outer layer. Not too salty, not too oddly textured, just right.\nGreek fries - 5/5 If nothing else, get this. Perfectly crispy fries that stayed crispy, good bit of cheese without being greasy, and slightly seasoned enough to make you come back for more.\nGreek yogurt with baklava and honey - 3/5 Perhaps it was because we weren't huge greek yogurt fans to begin with, but the baklava mixture was overly sweet and the yogurt too tart for our liking. \n\nOverall: 4/5 - nice ambience, hit or miss food items, no insane wait times.",

I have tried this place multiple times and each time have ordered more and more of the extra sauces in the hopes that I could liven up the food. Even the sauces are kind of thick and creamy and bland. \n\nThe main problem is when you order a pita, whether with chicken or lamb, the pita is basically a giant thick \"shoe\" of a pita. They don't even bother to split the pita open and stuff and like most Mediterranean places. They just dump a bunch of meat on top of a whole pita and curl it up like a super thick taco.  \n\nThe lamb is definitely the more bland of the choices so you're better off ordering the chicken which is fairly moist but still needs more. They should offer hummus and tabouli and baba ganoush and things like that that you can at least stick into the sandwich to give it some more flavor.  \n\nOn the plus side, the fries are very good but you do need some dipping sauces to go with them. I get that this is a concept place with a limited menu on purpose but I think they can offer more and do better.",

There was no structure, with around 30 people waiting to pick up food. I initially waited in a supposed \"line\" more like a hodgepodge of people not knowing where to go for about 10 minutes, then everyone kept cutting in front to pick up their order from the window, so I inched closer to do so and by the end of it was surrounded by people, a foot away from me, and a person even pushing into me at one point. I arrived when my order was ready and could not pick up the meal until 45 minutes later because of this system. This is not acceptable. I don't care about waiting for a meal, I get they are busy, but by being this irresponsible with COVID-19 they should not be open. If you can't make your customers feels safe while picking up salad you should not be open. They are risking people's lives by exposing them to other people in an unsafe way.",

I really enjoy the ambiance of all the locations I've been to as they all have ample seating for everyone.

      "text": "Souvla on Divisadero Street is a welcoming restaurant that looks small from the outside, but it is decently sized with a good amount of seating inside the restaurant (4-6 tables), as well as in the back patio (5-7 tables). The patio is a perfect place to enjoy your meal and there are also light and heaters outside, so that you can enjoy your meal. When you arrive to Souvla, you first order and then find a seat. I wouldn't recommend large groups at this location because there are many tables, however, many of them only seat 4 people and I feel as if it would be quite difficult to find tables to eat together as a group of more than 4. The staff at this location is friendly and knowledgeable about their menu.\n\nSouvla is a fresh and healthy greek restaurant. There menu consists of mainly salads and gyros, but they also sell sides such as fries, soup, and vegetables. A unique part of their menu is their fresh greek yogurt. \n\nI love Souvla and I would even consider it one of my favorite restaurants in San Francisco. I personally love the chicken salad. It has a wide variety of greens (kale and fennel), oranges, pickled red onions, cheese, and rotisserie chicken with their homemade \"granch\" dressing all on top. While it is a large amount of food and a delicious meal, it is priced at $17. The same meal but in the gyro form (wrapped in pita bread) is priced at $16. Although I would never spend that much money on a salad anywhere else, I would recommend this salad to a friend because it is simple and delicious, while being fresh and bursting with flavor. Souvla has a \"greek style\" that you can get on any meal with french fries on top for an additional $1. Although I have never tried this, I am aware that it is very popular here.\n\nAnother item you cannot skip out on is the Baklava Greek Yogurt. This dessert is simply greek yogurt with honey and baklava. I had never tried baklava prior to Souvla, but it is similar to a granola, however a bit sweeter. It is such a refreshing dessert without being too sugary.",

Cause first time I tried souvla and hayes valley and was not a fan....but always wanted to try the froyo. \n\nWeird to say that this is the first time I've had froyo that tastes like actual yogurt. Its one of those things you don't realize til you have the real deal. \n\nHighly recommend with baklava crumbles, the sweetness balances the tartness. Although its kinda steep...$8....I think I'd still prefer boba if ima pay that kind money yaknow?",

We ordered their:\n\nVeg Salad\nLamb Sandwich\nGreek Fries\n\nThe Veg Salad thankfully tasted the same as how I ordered it before, but the Lamb Sandwich seemed less filling and fulfilling in comparison to their salad version. The big disappointment of the night was probably the fries, they looked like Burger King's fries but with garnishes! The real kicker was that it's a $1 up charge for a side of ketchup, which doesn't make sense because when you order online the $1 up charge is nowhere to be found? Even Burger King doesn't charge for their ketchup packets, but nickel and diming like this isn't right.\n\nThere needs to be more cohesiveness between their online ordering versus IRL.",

Overall, like the food here but it is a bit expensive for what you get.\n\nHave been here several times and recommend the salads over the sandwich. In particular, I like the Chicken & Black Sheep Plant-Based Lamb\n\nTheir crown jewel, in my opinion, is their frozen greek yogurt. It's not too sweet, has a great texture, and has a lot of great toppings. The sour cherry syrup is AMAZING - Perfect mix of sweet & tart. I also really enjoy their Greek Fries - it's topped with cheese & is great with their \"Granch\".\n\nSouvla is super reliable and has a bunch of locations across the city.

The only bad critique about the chicken sandwich would be that it's very messy to eat because of the olive oil. Anyways- what goes better with a sandwich than with some fries, amirite? Unfortunately, I got this to go so the Greek fries were a bit soggy and cold, still yum, but I'm sure the fries are really good if I ate it there. Overall, pretty solid and super filling. \nI've heard good things about their Greek yogurt so I'll definitely come back to try that the next time.",

      "text": "Souvla Ratings: 4.1/5\n\nFood: 4.25/5 - My boyfriend and I live really close to Souvla, so we went there to grab a quick lunch. I heard a lot of good things about this place, especially  their Greek yogurt, so I definitely wanted to try it out. The Greek yogurt met my expectations, but the sandwiches not so much. See the description below for more detailed descriptions. \n\n- Mary's Free-Range Chicken [GET]: The chicken sandwich comes with chunks of rotisserie chicken, fennel, navel orange, pickled red onion, pea shoot, and cheese. The chicken meat was very juicy, tender, and well-marinated. Love all the ingredients, especially the orange pieces. I think it compliments well with the chicken, and it gave the sandwich a touch of freshness. The downfall was that the pita bread; it was very hard to chew and bite into and pretty stale, definitely not a warm toasted pita bread. It tasted like it's been sitting out from the oven for a while. Ask for hot sauce on the side, it's pretty good with the sandwich. The flavors are quite mild and on the bland side as well, so do not expect in kick in the face with strong and bold unique Greek flavors, but I kind wished they had with their sandwiches.\n\n- Frozen Greek Yogurt [GET]: I am a huge fan of FAGE yogurt, so I was very excited. I got the baklava crumbles and honey syrup frozen Greek yogurt, because it is the most popular one. The consistency is like soft serve with a strong Greek and tangy flavor to it. I really like it. The crumbles were a lot soggy and softer than I expected, wished it was more crumbly and flaky for the texture. The light touch of the honey syrup was great, definitely helps balancing out the sourness from the Greek yogurt. This is a great snack and a healthy treat, super light and refreshing, yet rich in flavor. \n\nAmbiance: 4.75/5 - I love the atmosphere here. Interior is very cute with tables in the long hallway that leads you directly to the patio. The backyard patio is a great place on a sunny day to enjoy some Greek yogurt and fries, quite intimate and cozy with lights at night. A hidden neighborhood gem. They also got a cute take-out windows for pick-up orders. A great spot for a casual meal or a date.\n\nPrice: 3.5/5 - My boyfriend got the Pork Shoulder sandwich for $14.50, the free-range chicken sandwich was $15.50, and the frozen Greek yogurt was $6. The total came up to be around $40 after tax. I think for the taste of the sandwiches, I'd say it was only okay in terms of worthiness, and they are on the pricey side. \n\nService: 4/5 - The service was good and fast. We order at the front with a staff, and she was nice and friendly. She explained to me the difference between the dressing and asked if we needed any extra sauces or utensils. The menu is easy to understand and interpret. The take-out packaging was clean and simple, so we had a smooth experience.  \n\nBLUF: This is the perfect spot for a quick bite of Mediterranean food such as pita wraps and salad bowls. Although the food was decent and the frozen Greek yogurt was delicious, but slightly overpriced, so I think it will take me a while to make a second visit, but will return anytime when I'm craving the yogurt. Honestly, I recommend just go for the frozen Greek yogurt and skip the entrees.",

Then again, I don't know how hard it is to make Greek yogurt incorrectly but their consistency is like SOFT SERVE. Cant go wrong with the baklava crumble and honey Greek yogurt which is apparently the most popular option, but if you're adventurous they are also known for their olive oil and sea salt yogurt. \n\nI got it to-go and the yogurt melts quickly, but is very filling. Perfect for a midday snack that is also on the healthier end. Will be back to try their other flavors soon!",

I enjoyed the pita bread. I just wish it wasn't doused in oil. My sandwich was dripping oil the entire time I was eating it, and a puddle of oil started accumulating on the tray. I also wish the yogurt was more evenly spread.\n\nMy friends got the chicken sandwich. Apparently, they thought the orange slices were a strange addition.

      "text": "It's hard these days to find options that aren't too heavy, but also aren't salad! The perfect alternative was the chicken sandwich (which is really a pita wrap) - the feta and orange slices balanced out the chicken with some nice richness and brightness. It looks unassuming but it actually made me so full. Meanwhile, the greek yogurt tasted just like literal frozen Greek yogurt (although it lacked the thickness/creaminess I was expecting, and was rather like an icier soft serve) which means I shall store Souvla in my internal roster of lighter dessert options as well. Loved the sour cherry syrup as a fruity accent, but considering Greek yogurt is tangy already, I will likely try the honey or olive oil next time!",

I can attest that the food at Souvla is authentic, with a SF influence. The meat was perfectly cooked, the greens fresh, and combination of flavors soo delicious. My daughters chicken wrap had slices of oranges in it, that added bright flavor point to the rest of the ingredients. My salad with lamb had tender kale that was perfectly dressed.

They have a cute and convenient pick up window on the outside which is where we got our food.\n\nMy friend and I shared their Greek Fries. The fries were hot and crispy. Although we both noted that we couldn't taste the lemon juice on the fries--which was disappointing. To eat we both ordered the Pork Sandwich, which to me tasted like a healthier carnitas burrito! My friend got all of the fixings while I opted for no cheese and sauce on the side. When we looked at my friend's sandwich there wasn't any sauce in hers so I gave her some of mine. The Minted Yogurt sauce was tangy. The sandwich itself was loaded with pork and veggies--to the point where everything was spilling out! The veggies were refreshing with the meat. Without them, in my opinion, the sandwich would be too heavy. One downside was how greasy both of our sandwiches and wrappers were. Not sure if it was because we took out or waited a bit to eat it but it made things a little messy.\n\nOverall, the food is fresh and filling. I'm glad I got to try and check Souvla off my list.",

Recently, however, it's really fallen off in taste and texture. \n\nPerhaps souvla have over extended their chefs in training with all the expansion. Perhaps it has to do with no longer rotating rotisserie with fresh chicken nonstop. I can't tell, but yesterday I brought my parents and boyfriend here as they always loved this spot when in town in the past.\n\nHowever, the previously juicy with the perfect texture and moisture and fat balanced chicken on the chicken salad was dry and chewy and barely flavorful. The pork in the pork sandwich seemed flavorless and dry. Worst of all was the lamb in the lamb sandwich which was chewy without juices or flavor. If you lose the art of the meat, souvla just becomes overpriced sandwiches and salads on the go.\n\nLet's get the quality back to the good old days, Souvla!",

I would love to come back to try the food as well.\n\nFood:\n- Frozen Yogurt--$5\nI couldn't decide between two flavors, but luckily since I had read some Yelp reviews beforehand, I knew that I could get two flavors! I asked the worker helping me which flavors would go well together and they suggested the Greek Sour Cherry Syrup and the Baklava Crumbles & Honey Syrup. It was a great recommendation as the tartness of the cherry syrup paired so well with the sweetness of the honey and baklava. The contrast in texture was also nice with the plump cherry bits with the crumbly, crunchy yet soft baklava. The frozen yogurt itself was smooth and velvety but still light and refreshing and not too rich and dense.\n\nTips:\n- You can get two flavors for the frozen yogurt!\n- Must-Try Items: Greek Sour Cherry Syrup and Baklava Crumbles & Honey Syrup Frozen Yogurt",

I washed it down with a decent white wine and they let me try to the Rose before I settled on the white.\n\nNext time I will try the fries which many people have told me are really great.

I personally like concise menus so I'm not standing there wondering what to order. Their salad option is so delicious! Even though it's more pricier than a gyro, I would opt for the salad for two reasons. First, it's just healthier, and secondly I love the mixture of salad they use! I believe it's kale with romaine lettuce and they add radish and pickled onions. So delicious. With COVID precautions, it's only takeout but TIP! Ask for the salad dressing on the side. It was a bit too much for me and ended up drowning my salad. \n\nAlso, a must order is their frozen Greek yogurt, specifically the Baklava crumbs and honey. My god, I crave that. It's a good enough portion for two people. Highly recommend since it's not too sweet and it's creamy.",

Be a decent human being.\n\nI grabbed one of their sandwiches - which is really a wrap. It was giant, extremely filling and delicious. I also couldn't decide between soft potatoes or french fries - and went with both. And both were delicious.

But the taste was pretty mediocre. They had hot sauce on the table which was very necessary as the lamb was kinda bland and there wasn't too much else with flavor in the pita. It wasn't horrible. But it felt like I was eating generic pita filler. I think they are trying to be healthy and light rather than flavorful. \n\nWe also got the yogurt which was pretty good. It's different than regular frozen yogurt since it's greek so very strong and tangy. I'd come back to grab some frozen yogurt to go, but probably won't come back here again.

It's essentially counter surface and they'll give you your food with a number. \n\nI think the price is definitely worth it for how fresh the salad is, and how tender the rotisserie chicken is. Unless you're really hungry, you might be able to split the salad into two meals. That's always worth it for me! \n\nThe guy told me I need to try the lamb sandwich next time. Hopefully the frozen yogurt is just as good too!\n\nMy star rating:\n5  - you have to go!!! \n4 - you won't be disappointed \n3  - it was okay \n2  - I probably won't go back \n1  - turnaround and run",

Particularly I love the back patio area, it's so nice to sit outside on a nice sunny day and enjoy my Soulva! \n\nI've tried the lamb and chicken (pita sandwich + salad) and both protein and variation are bomb-tastic. I highly recommend either, and next time I'm going to try the pork shoulder! \n\nFries are absolute must-get. Be sure to get a dip too (my fav is the yogurt one). For some extra flavor, try dipping some into the hot sauce.\n\nLast but not least, please be sure to get yourself (and one for each of your guests/friends/family/loved ones) a greek yogurt and you can never go wrong with baklava crumbles topping. Delicious :) I am so happy as I write this review because every day with Souvla is an amazing day. \n\nThank you, Souvla!",

      "text": "It is very rare to find a modern twist on Greek food, but here it is! When I order a Greek salad, I don't plan on finding pickled onions, orange and pea shoots. Honestly I think my yia yia would hit me with a wooden spoon if she saw me order this salad. But it was really good! They call the dressing \"Granch\" but it just tasted like liquidy tzatziki (not a bad thing). I also got a side of the Greek Fries. Crunchy and perfectly seasoned with olive oil, lemon juice, parsley and cheese. The perfect side. I guess the funky take isn't for everyone because my boyfriend got the chicken sandwich and wasn't a fan. To each their own! \n\nI'm so happy to have found this place when I was craving something healthy but still hearty after a long week of overindulging in food. Mediterranean is always a safe bet. We weren't quite sure how it worked when we walked in but it's simple. Order at the counter and take your number to your table where they will bring you your food. They have a really cute outdoor section in the back with heat lamps but it was a little too chilly for me still. You can grab a bottle of water from the wall near the counter and as many glasses as you need. The space is so beautiful and classy while still feeling casual. I loved it. I felt like I was almost in my own restaurant - choosing my own table, getting glasses and a bottle as I need it. \n\nMenu is pretty straight forward! Just pick your meat- pork, chicken, lamb or veggies, and how you want it- salad or sandwich. Easy peasy delicious. Enjoy!",

I wasn't the biggest fan of the salad dressing. The chicken was a tad on the dry side. But a fun option is that you can add fries to all the salad bowls for an extra cost.\n- Juicy Potatoes: I thought these were good, but I probably wouldn't order them again. They are juicy, and flavored sweetly.\n- Greek Fries: YUM definitely get the fries. They come out freshly hot and seasoned really nicely. I want more already!\n- Baklava Crumbles & Honey Syrup Greek Yogurt: ugh I love me some frozen Greek yogurt. These toppings were also pretty good. You can count me to come back for the Greek yogurt.",

Long story short, Michelle knows great food!\n\nThe restaurant itself is long and narrow, with seating at the front of the restaurant, outside, and down the hall. Order at the counter located in the middle of the restaurant and then you are free to sit where you'd like. Just place your number on the table, and someone will bring your food out to you.\n\nWe ordered the Mary's Free-Range Chicken Sandwich. This came with \"Granch\" dressing, fennel, navel orange, pickled red onion, pea shoots, and mizithra cheese in a pita bread. After my first bite, I was literally speechless. It was SO SO good! I couldn't put it down! The chicken was shredded, tender, and they gave a LOT! The dressing was super tasty, and the many ingredients were so well-balanced in flavor and quantity! We also had the Lamb Salad. This had harissa-spiked yogurt, cucumber, radish, pickled red onion, and feta cheese. Don't get me wrong, this salad was amazing, but the Chicken Sandwich won my heart! I cannot wait to come back! Please open a location in the South Bay!",

With Covid and the transition to take-out orders only, it's understandable that many businesses have a longer wait time so a quick and easy way to order and pick up is always appreciated.\n\nWe ordered the lamb and chicken salads which were delicious! I'm usually not a fan of fruits in my salads, however, the addition of mandarins in the salads were very tasty. The highlight of the order was definitely the frozen Greek yogurt with baklava & honey! It's been a few days since I've had Souvla and I've caught myself thinking about the frozen Greek yogurt on multiple occasions.\n\nIt looks like they also have a really cute back patio that would be great for outdoor seating so I surely have to come back and enjoy that, Post-COVID!",

Even tho I get stuffed I have to eat the fries with harissa sauce! \n    This location is a bit bigger than other locations and there is additional outdoor seating in the back of the restaurant. I don't recommend sitting in front of the rotisserie when they're cooking chicken bc it's blazing hot!!",

      "text": "I definitely think Souvla is more for the people who enjoy salads and healthy foods. I came here on a Saturday and it was pretty crowded. We waited about 10 minutes in line to order. You have to order first and then sit down. I ordered the pork salad bowl. There was a looot of kale in it! We also got their greek fries. I think you can live without the fries as they mostly tasted like regular fries. I couldn't really taste the seasoning on top. My pork salad bowl was huuge. I'm not sure if it's because I didn't really enjoy that type of food or because there was too much kale or maybe of both? I thought it was nothing special. I did feel like they gave you a huge portion so you could have this for lunch and then enjoy leftovers for dinner. \n\nIf I come back again, I will definitely try their greek yogurt!",

      "text": "I'm conflicted between giving Souvla a 3/5 or a 4/5, and I'll explain why. I had this place on my radar for a while and I was excited to finally swing by and grab dinner but also see what the hype for this frozen Greek yogurt was about.\nThe way Souvla works (or at least this location) is that you stand on line, order, take a number, and then sit wherever you want. They don't have too many options so I ended up choosing the Superior Farms Lamb Leg Gyro (~$14) along with a side of Greek Fries (~$5) to share.\nThe Lamb Gyro comes with harissa-spiked yogurt, cucumber, radish, pickled red onions, and feta cheese. The Greek Fries are mixed with olive oil, lemon juice, parsley, and cheese.\nWhat I didn't enjoy was that the lamb pieces were chunks. They were tough and chewy. The gyro wrap wasn't warm so it felt pretty hard. There was also an overwhelming amount of feta cheese compared to everything else. I ended up opening it up to eat everything but the feta and gyro wrap. It was just disappointing. The Greek fries were solid and made up for the wrap, but only so much.\nAfter dinner, I hopped back on line to finally try the Frozen Greek Yogurt (~$5)! I got the one with Baklava Crumbles & Honey Syrup. I love the cup design. It has an old time New York coffee cup vibe to it. The frozen Greek yogurt was light and tasted exactly like you'd imagine. The real winner is the baklava and honey. It was super tasty and although it was a bit difficult to separate the pieces out, once the frozen yogurt melted a bit, that was no longer an issue.\nOverall, lamb gyro - 3/5, Greek fries - 4/5, and frozen Greek yogurt - 4/5. I wouldn't get the gyro again and definitely don't recommend it. It wasn't an authentic take on the gyro and the flavors were pretty lackluster. I'm willing to give Souvla another try but also not excited to come back here.",

We came here on Labor Day at noon and waited no more than 5 minutes for our order to be taken. \n\nFOOD: I ordered the lamb sandwich and my friend ordered the pork sandwich. While I actually preferred his pork sandwich to mine, he said that the lamb undoubtedly surpassed the pork sandwich and he would have ordered the lamb if he had known. We also got their fries which were okay, nothing too special. And of course, we had to have our baklava and Greek yogurt (we actually went to the Valencia location after the Divisadero location since this ice cream machine was broken). I'm not a big fan of Greek yogurt, but I would eat Souvla's any day of the week. It was absolutely amazing and I couldn't get enough even though I was so full from lunch. \n\nSERVICE: good. Nothing extraordinary, but kind hosts and waiters who brought our food. \n\nIf you're in SF, Souvla is a must visit. Their sandwiches are comparable to other Mediterranean restaurants, but their Greek yogurt is unbeatable!",

      "text": "Souvla has come up a few times as an office lunch choice. I finally decided to see what they were all about on Friday, October 6th. Our delivery order arrived via Caviar around 12:15pm.\n\n*Pork Sandwich: American homestead pork shoulder with minted Greek yogurt, cherry tomato, pickled red onion, cucumber, and feta cheese wrapped in fresh and warm pita bread, Yogurt on the Side ($11)\n*Greek Fries: Crispy fries tossed in olive oil, lemon juice, herbs, and mizithra cheese ($4)\n*Greek Frozen Yogurt ($5): Baklava Crumbles and Honey Syrup (+$2)\n\nFirst off, the sandwich is huge! Especially with the huge pita bread. I'm not much of a pita person, so I mostly just ate the insides. Flavor wise, I thought the whole sandwich was a little bland. It needed more than just the yogurt sauce to add flavor. The fries were great! Arrived crispy which is hard when it comes to delivery. I actually used the yogurt from my sandwich as a dipping sauce for the fries. I liked the froyo as it was nice and tart. The baklava was a little hard to eat as it came in a giant clump on top of my dessert. It was hard to break apart and eat with the fro-yo. Not sure if this was due to the transit time, but I could have done without baklava. Glad I tried it though.\n\nIn the end, I wasn't wowed by their sandwich, but I enjoyed the rest of the items. Too bad as the sandwich was the main item. Overall, 3 stars.",

I tend to get fries only and go to the back garden under the heat lamps. There is very limited parking so don't expect not to walk a ways. Also, this place tends to be crowded but in the very back there is a long table and bar with a couple seats open. People do tend to stay and enjoy the scene.

This place is classy, yet casual -- you order your food at the counter, receive a number, sit down, and wait for your food to be served. Despite the casualness, the restaurant is chic, bright, and airy and the NoPa patio is oh so dreamy! \n\nThe prices are super reasonable by SF standards -- $11-13 for an entree. I ordered the pork shoulder pita sandwich and my dining companion ordered the lamb pita sandwich. Both meats were tender and seasoned to perfection. The pita sandwich is quite substantial and I couldn't even finish mine (probably because I couldn't stop snacking on the Greek fries!!). The frozen Greek yogurt looked tempting, but I was too full after eating dinner here to order any. So of course I had to came back the next day for frozen Greek yogurt topped with olive oil and sea salt. It was delightful and I'm convinced it's the perfect snack!\n\nEverything I tried at Souvla was incredible. I definitely think this restaurant is worth the hype.",

      "text": "After a morning of walking around SF, this was exactly what I needed to refuel. I got the lamb salad bowl and it was amazing. The lamb was tender and flavorful. The pickled red onion and feta cheese also packed a big flavor punch! I was full after I ate, otherwise I would have loved to try the baklava frozen Greek yogurt! \n\nThe restaurant itself is really cute, there's lots of light and seating inside, out front, and outback. The only drawback is that there's one bathroom. \n\nBottom line: Try the lamb bowl. If you're extra hungry, get the fries on top or save room for dessert!",

      "text": "This place gets a big negative 1 star in my book. Me and my family order two salads, fries, yogurts and a whole chicken. The weird thing about this place is that they have a big rotisserie display but the only sell their chicken in a to go box. When i get my order of salad and fries, i had to go back to get my order of chicken. They don't chop it up for you, so i tear out a drum stick. Then one of the workers tells me that i can't do that here. Wait did i not pay for this chicken that came from here? Well yes i did pay. Was there a sign to not eat chicken here? No there wasn't. Do after we are it salad we left. \n\nSo that left a bad taste in my mouth. \n\nNow on to the food. The salad it self was okay. Chicken what i was able to eat was dry and bland.\n\nMy recommendation is to go to RT Rotisserie. 10 times better in favor and value.",

      "text": "Two words: baklava froyo. It never fails to remind me of an old high school classmate who told our economics teacher in all seriousness that proximity to a froyo place was critical in helping her narrow down her college search. I'm not sure where she is these days, but I hope she finds her way to Souvla soon.\n\nBut the rest of Souvla's food is so good that it makes it incredibly difficult to still have room for dessert. I am a creature of habit, so I always go with either the chicken sandwich or salad. The \"granch\" dressing (I think it's supposed to be a Greek yogurt-based ranch), pickled red onion, mizithra cheese, incredibly juicy chicken, and naval orange combination is beyond flavorful. In fact, the chicken is so juicy that it can make the sandwich fairly messy to eat, so bear that in mind.\n\nI've eaten at both the Hayes Valley and NoPa locations, but I definitely prefer this one on Divisadero. The atmosphere of both locations is pretty consistent with the same kind of Instagrammable decor found at every trendy spot in San Francisco these days, but it's more spacious here (brownie points for the heated patio in the back!), something for which you'll be thankful when it inevitably gets crowded.\n\nLet's get down to business now: the baklava froyo. It's frozen Greek yogurt topped with baklava crumbles and honey syrup. Don't forget to mix the baklava while you eat to maintain a good baklava-to-yogurt ratio. The sweetness of the baklava and the tartness of the Greek yogurt is a match made in heaven.",

Seriously, everything on the menu is epically delicious and made with such high quality ingredients. \n\nI'm familiar with the menu as I've been eating at the Souvla location in Hayes Valley since it opened and love the fact that there's one on Divisadero St. too! Yesterday I opted for the chicken salad which is so damn delicious. I usually opt for the lamb because it's a tough protein to do well at home but, chicken sounded good. Oh, also went \"Greek style\" which is a topping of fries and it's just legendary. \n\nLook. Moral of the story is that you can't loose with your order. It's all perfection in a wrap, bowl. Boom.",

      "text": "I've seen so many aerial shots of Souvla, and I've always thought of it as just another gentrified place with colorful salads and enticing-looking swirls of frozen Greek yogurt. Although I still do feel like it's quite gentrification-y, I found myself quite satisfied with the food (and enticed by the Greek yogurt P:)\n\nTL;DR - Tasty California-Greek fast-casual, but so expensive! Wraps are $10 veggie, $11 pork, $12 chicken, $13 lamb. +$1 for the salad. I probably subconsciously gulped with each extra dollar I noticed as I scanned the menu. We ended up spending $30 for a quick lunch for two o.O\n\nThe CHICKEN SALAD turned out to be hearty and surprisingly filling. I liked the kale base, though the random pieces of romaine seemed out of place. Overall, the citrusy navel orange, sweet pea shoots, mildly pickled red onion, and decadent mizithra cheese shavings created a delicious, well-rounded salad. I wish I asked for less dressing (it's \"Granch\", tasted identical to ranch; would have much preferred a healthier yogurt based sauce like all the other choices). I appreciated the generous portions of roast chicken, but it was too salty and dry in my opinion. I had trouble finishing it towards the end because it was so salty! But I guess the healthiness from the kale and free-range chicken balances out the negative health effects of all the salt :3\n\nI also took a bite of the boo's PORK SANDWICH. As you are greeted by rows of rotisserie pork shoulder with salivation-inducing aroma at Souvla, I was excited to try this slow-roasted pork. It had good flavor, but like the chicken, I found it way too salty. \n\nDespite my complaints of the saltiness, the famous frozen Greek yogurt comes to the rescue for a dessert of redemption. We got the CRETAN WILDFLOWER HONEY YOGURT (because I'm too cheap to pay an extra dollar for the baklava crumbles :) and it was magical. The tart yogurt paired excellently with the sweet, floral honey. It reminded me of Shake Shack's frozen custard, only healthier and lighter. The consistency was also perfect, not too frozen and not too melty while we devoured it. \n\nOne thing about their food that was unexpected is the lack of hummus. Seeing that it's such a big health food trend, I think their menu would benefit from some hummus spreads and sauces. (They could even use Costco/mass-produced hummus, and no one would really know!)\n\nThe space is picture-perfect--olive wreaths on the walls, wooden tables, metal stools. Service is also very fast; the food arrives in no time after you order. \n\nThe verdict? Kale salads, free-range chicken, Greek yogurt, hefty prices, Pinterest-like decor, and inclination for aerial Instagrams scream gentrification, but the frozen greek yogurt... I'm sold.",

Hubs wasn't hip on the idea of Mediterranean since he goes on business trips there and has had his share of it. \n\nI dragged him here anyway and he was just as pleased as I was! We ordered the pork shoulder sandwich, fries and salad. The sandwich was huge, we shared it and still couldn't finish it! The fries were mediocre, I think I'll order the juicy potatoes next time. The salad was delicious. With feta, olives, cucumber, romaine, tomatoes, and kale. Both the sandwich and salad was on point! \n\nThe cashier was friendly and the service was fast! We dined outside in their urban landscaped patio. I'll definitely make a return trip if I'm in the area! Delicious, fast, fresh and healthy food!",

      "text": "With New Year's having just passed, I'm sure we're all still keeping with our resolutions to eat healthier and to lose those extra pounds we've been lugging around.  To be sure, it's not easy to stay disciplined with hitting the gym and eating healthy, but it's definitely a lot easier when you can eat salads as delicious as Souvla's!  Yes, they may not be the healthiest ones out there, but HEY...it's better than not eating a salad at all!\n\nSince I've never been to their spot in Hayes Valley, it may (or may not) be better than this Souvla, but I still think this one is pretty damn awesome!  While it initially looks small, there's actually a good amount of seating (they have a nice back patio area).  Most  importantly though, the food is terrific!  The menu isn't extensive (choice of pork, chicken, lamb, or vegetarian as a salad or sandwich/wrap, sides, soup, and frozen Greek yogurt), but I've enjoyed just about everything I've tried.\n\n-- GREEK FRIES - Olive OIl, Lemon Juice, Parsley, Mizithra Cheese (with Harissa-Spiked Yogurt)...$4 (+$1)\n(yelp.com/biz_photos/souv…)\nThe Harissa-spiked yogurt (which is the same as the one in the lamb salad, I believe) made for a terrific dip, but honestly, it was kind of unnecessary as the fries were PERFECT!  I loved the mizithra cheese and lemon juice, but I was most impressed with how crispy the fries were!\n\n-- SUPERIOR FARMS LAMB LEG - Harissa-Spiked Yogurt, Cucumber, Radish, Pickled Red Onions, Feta Cheese...$14 (Salad)\n(yelp.com/biz_photos/souv…)\nDespite really wanting to try their pork, I felt compelled to get the lamb the first time I came here (Greek restaurant and all).  Thankfully, it didn't disappoint!  The lamb tasted great, was really tender, and wasn't the least bit gamy.  What's more, the harissa-spiked yogurt and feta complemented the lamb really well.\n\n-- MARY'S FREE-RANGE CHICKEN - \"Granch\" Dressing, Fennel, Navel Orange, Pickled Red Onions, Pea Shoots, Mizithra Cheese...$13 (Salad)\n(yelp.com/biz_photos/souv…)\nI was hopeful, given how good the chickens looked spinning inside the rotisserie oven, but it was underwhelming.  While decently flavorful, the chicken's consistency was uneven; some pieces were fine, others were hard and dry.  Still, the rest of the salad was pretty tasty, especially the dressing and the brightness the oranges added.\n\n-- AMERICAN HOMESTEAD PORK SHOULDER - Minted Greek Yogurt, Cherry Tomato, Pickled Red Onion, Cucumber, Feta Cheese...$12 (Salad)\n(yelp.com/biz_photos/souv…)\nMy favorite of the three.  Not only was the pork cooked perfectly (crisp on the outside, juicy and moist on the inside), but it tasted AWESOME!  The seasoning on the pork was great and mixed really well with the minted yogurt, feta cheese, and pickled red onions.  Delicious!\n\n-- CRETAN WILDFLOWER HONEY Frozen Greek Yogurt...$4\n(yelp.com/biz_photos/souv…)\nUnlike what I expected, the yogurt was really creamy and not quite as tart as I thought it'd be (which is a good thing).  Of course, the honey definitely helped with the latter.  I'm not sure how to describe it, but the honey felt lighter and sweeter than regular honey (though not abrasively sweet).  Thankfully, it didn't have a strong floral tinge to it either.\n\n-- BAKLAVA CRUMBLES & HONEY SYRUP Frozen Greek Yogurt...$5\n(yelp.com/biz_photos/souv…)\nAs much as I liked the Cretan Wildflower on the frozen yogurt, the Baklava was so much better!  Not only was there a good amount of it, but the baklava added a nice textural contrast and had just the right sweetness to offset the tartness of the yogurt.  YUM!\n\nBeyond simply how good all of the food was, Souvla is a fantastic value for the money.  I haven't had their sandwiches/wraps yet, but $12-14 for a salad this tasty and filling?  I paid the same for a salad at Squat & Gobble and it wasn't nearly this god!  Plus, the workers here are all so friendly, which makes just that much better in my book.\n\nSouvla, you probably aren't as healthy for me as I'd like to think you are, but I sincerely hope that I'm wrong...because your salads (and frozen Greek yogurt) are definitely something I can build a diet around!",

There are two Souvla locations in SF - this one is a bit bigger but not the original. \n\nIf you like gyros this place has such tasty flavors and a great variety! You can choose between a sandwich or salad - both pretty big portions. I ordered the lamb sandwich with a side of fries. Unfortunately, I think I was given the chicken sandwich instead of the lamb because the toppings were totally different than my friend who ordered the same thing. Regardless of that, I thought the flavors were amazing (although it would've been better if I got the lamb). \n\nMy favorite part of Souvla is their Greek yogurt soft serve which my friend raved about. We actually ended up visiting both locations because the machine at this one was broken. This is a MUST if you're at Souvla. The Greek yogurt with baklava crumble and honey syrup was so good. The yogurt itself is pretty good but the baklava crumble takes it over the top! I would highly recommend.",

      "text": "A review for the NOPA Location: I've been a fan of Souvla for a while, and everyone that works there has always seemed very friendly, and the food is excellent, but today's customer service seemed exceptional. The woman who was working the front of the house & register, Leah, was so warm and friendly. My friend and I each ordered a Greek white wine, and afterward, while ringing us up, Leah asked us if we had ever tried the Retsina wine. We hadn't, and she asked us if we'd like to try it. She described it perfectly as being earthy & an interesting flavor palette. The wine itself was good, but her kindness and genuine personality are what left an impression. It was a lovely interaction and way of showcasing another product without coming across as trying to sell someone something. Later on, as my friend and I were still chatting away, she came by to clear our plates, and we chatted with her a bit and discovered she had only been working there a couple of weeks. I just wanted to thank her for the excellent customer service and let her employers know what a great employee she is. You're lucky to have her!",

If you sit in the private patio area though, you won't want to leave.\n\nChose the lamb salad and Greek fries- salad was super fresh and more than I could finish. Ask to add on tomatoes, and use the house hot sauce. I hear their chicken salad is even better, so I'll probably switch to that next time. The fries with garlic dipping sauce were just okay, wouldn't get them again.",

The hot blue blaze hypnotizes as the fat droplets pull away from the protein bundle and hit the fires below. Hissssss.\n\n* hey babe, can we have one of those things in our living room?! who needs a fireplace?! *\n\nOk, FOCUS. \n\nWhen you come here, you'll know to order at the counter, pay, take your number and sit down at the copper topped community table. Or if the sun is shining in its full glory, head to the back and enjoy their two-tiered patio. It's peaceful, personal and feels like discovering your own secret garden! (except other people know this secret too and will be sharing the space with you)\n\nThankfully, the food menu is short and sweet. You can't go wrong with getting the chicken or lamb salad. I almost always get lamb when I see it on the menu because it's one of those MMMeats that I don't prepare at home. Here, the salad is a deep bowl filled with nutritious greens, cucumber, radish, pickled red onions, feta cheese and drizzled with a harissa spiked yogurt dressing. It's an explosion of flavors! :0  and having a mound of shredded lamb leg meat will fill you up fast. \n\nDon't skip the crunchy Greek fries with a sprinkling of Mizithra cheese nor their delicious dessert. Since we were true yelpers (aka: fatties) we tried all 4 flavors of their Greek yogurt: sour cherry, classic EVOO & sea salt, wildflower honey and the baklava crumbles. Which is the winner? ALL of them! (told ya, we are fatties!) \n\nI'm enamored with Souvla and now I have more reasons to go to the DivCo corridor aside from Nopa up the street. Welcome to the neighborhood!",

If you are here with a small appetite and know you couldn't possibly eat both a salad (or sandwich) and dessert, then its an easy choice.  Get the fro yo!",

      "text": "Souvla was an amazing gastronomic adventure in flavors. I ordered the weekend special breakfast wrap with lamb, and the dish was savory. They certainly know how to blend the flavors well between the feta, scrambled eggs, lamb and wrap. Be advised, it is a bit messy to eat, but the primary reason it's so messy is that the wrap is fresh and soft to the touch, so it isn't the best at staying together, but the staff here have certainly planned for this, and the wrap is served on a tray to catch every morsel to be scooped up a fork when done with the main portion.\n\nI ordered Greek fries with my wrap, and the fries are unlike any I've tasted before. They are seasoned with what are obviously fresh ingredients and not synthetic flavors. For an extra charge, the fries come with a Greek yogurt dipping sauce, which is perfectly paired to the fries. These servings of dipping sauce are only big enough for one set of fries as I learned the hard way because my friend I was with decided to eat most of my dipping sauce before I could get to my fries. \n\nThe space is a bit cramped, and I'd been here a few times prior but only to order off the dessert menu. This place is also great for a gourmet treat to walk and eat. The Greek yogurt with sour cherry sauce is delectable and not easily passed up. This dessert dish is also easy to walk and carry on night that this restaurant is too packed to enjoy dinner there. \n\nAs far as pricing goes, it's NOPA, so the prices seem reasonably matched to the neighborhood if not slightly on the lower side of what I would expect from a NOPA eatery. All in all, a hearty-sized breakfast wrap and a side of Greek fries with dipping sauce came out less than $21, so I have no complaint regarding the pricing and what I have come to expect from this type of establishment.",

      "text": "The Souvla baklava froyo is a passion of mine. I'm at the Independent for shows fairly frequently, and I make it a point to stop by for some Greek froyo and fries before hitting up the venue.\n\nI've very rarely seen the Souvla on Divisadero not be busy, but the crew is very efficient and the line moves quickly. I've found that my food generally comes out pretty speedily as well. Sometimes you have to camp out a bit to get a table, but I've never had an issue finding a spot to sit down.\n\nThe pork and lamb salads are my favorites for main dishes, but be warned - they're big meals. If sharing a meal with friends, a salad + a side or two are definitely more than filling. Half of the time, I just opt for the aforementioned froyo+fry combo and call that dinner.\n\nWhile all of the food is excellent, my undying love for Souvla stems purely from the baklava froyo. The froyo itself is perfectly thick, creamy, and tart - a unique experience that is only enhanced by the addition of baklava. Each bite is a delicious moment of joy. I'm a loyalist to the baklava and haven't tried the other flavors, but my boyfriend got the olive oil + sea salt flavor on a whim and didn't seem to be as enthused as I was about mine.\n\nMy only complaint is that I got a brief bout of food poisoning (or something of the ilk) from eating the juicy potatoes once, which was a huge bummer because they used to be my favorites. I can't think about them without feeling sick now, so I recommend that if they ever taste off to you, trust your gut (literally). That being said, I've been here many many times and never had a single issue, and there are so many other items on the menu that I still have plenty to choose from. I've been here many times since, and will definitely continue to come back.",

Souvla is overpriced and the meat is subpar in comparison to other spots in SF. \n\nI gave it a second try. I ordered online and have decided to never come back. After ordering to the wrong location, I tried to cancel immediately and even called the store so they didn't waste their time making it. No one answered so I emailed thinking they would refund me like any business would, or at the very least allow me pick up my food that i paid for. \nInstead, they prefer to lose a customer over their \"clearly stated policy\" that all sales are final, which is only stated in the confirmation email after you order. Don't bother with your time or money here. Any restaurant owner knows that the benefit of keeping one customer is higher than any cost of food waste. Their policy screams money hungry.",

The bussers are always on top of it and super quick to clear dishes to move tables quickly.\n\nWe ordered -\n\nPork salad - always my go-to. Tons of fresh, quality ingredients that contrast with each other so well. Juicy, fatty pork, crunchy cucumbers and onions, creamy dressing on hearty kale and romaine. One thing I don't like about the salad is that it comes with TOO MUCH feta. #firstworldproblem. A+\n\nLamb wrap - The creamy, spicy harissa sauce and well-seasoned lamb are the stars of this. The pita bread is soft, warm, and chewy. However, the distribution of ingredients was a bit off. The pita was so large that you had to eat it in two sections - the top & bottom of the pita. Top was all veggies while the bottom was the meat and sauce. It would have been nice for the ingredients to be mixed within the wrap or even just sauce ontop of the veggies. B\n\nFries - the fries were overcooked and too crunchy. The perfect fries should be crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, which these fries were not. Some fries felt like we were just biting through crust to get to the oily center. C\n\nVery affordable for the quality and quantity of food. Dinner for two after tax and tip was $40.",

We were trying to find a spot in the city that had quality organic food with an outdoor seating area. Souvla was the perfect place. \n\nThere was no wait and we easily found an outdoor table. They even brought out some water for my friends' dog.  The ambiance inside this particular location is lovely for any and all occasions. In addition to some front outdoor seating, they also have a back outdoor patio with heat lamps, which I saw a number of families enjoying.\n\nAt this particular Soulva, you order at the counter (their menu is simple and easy to order from.) and they have a swift team of staff that brings you out your dishes. Everything came out quickly and correctly.\n\nMy husband couldn't stop eating the fries and potatoes - lavishly drizzled in authentic Greek olive oil. My friends couldn't stop gushing about the quality of the meat and salad ingredients. And everyone's eyes beamed in delight as they enjoyed Souvla's decadent Greek Yogurt.\n\nFor superb - quick food - made with love and outstanding ingredients - Souvla is beyond what's up.\n\nTrust.",

I also ordered the baklava froyo which was tart and delicious. \n\nThe ambience and decor of the shop itself is also great, but it's a bit small. I would not recommend Souvla for large groups.

These are generous portions so you won't leave hungry.\n\nOn foggy rainy days or when I've got a bad cold, I love their Avgolemono soup- a traditional egg-lemon soup with chunks of pulled chicken and rice. It's creamy and puckery and warms you right up! \n\nThe Greek fries and potatoes are nice if you're still hungry. \nAnd yes, even the wine and beer are Greek! \n\nFor dessert, you guessed it, it's Greek Yogurt! But it's not your basic store bought stuff- it comes freshly made out of a soft serve machine and you have the option to add Greek Olive Oil & Flaky Sea Salt or Baklava Crumbles & Honey Syrup. I know... I can never make up my mind. \n\nSo whether it's a cold rainy day or during a rare heat wave, this place has got you covered with good food and yummy treats.

      "text": "I SO LOUV SOUVLA. Get it? I tried.\nbut really, I do love Souvla. \n\nIt has consistently satisfied my daily nutritional needs and filled my empty soul with joy. I've tried most of the items on the menu, and think I like the vegetarian salad the best. There are sweet potatoes in them! The soup I got last time was a bit salty, but forgivable because it is souvla. Everything is great or above great, so you can't really go wrong. Large portions, good flavor.\n\nI would definitely recommend the greek frozen yogurt. The baklava one t is really good, and so is the sea salt and olive oil one - despite the description. The other ones are just OK.\n\nI would go for the sea salt! Somehow the salt balances out the sweetness of the yogurt and makes it easier to devour barbarically like a gluttonous savage that I occasionally transform into during dessert time.",

I am glad I was able to take advantage of it before I moved to NYC, and also make sure I go there when I'm in San Francisco. \n\nThis location is my favorite, it's slightly bigger than the one in Hayes Valley. Cute outdoor patio with heat lamps, so pretty good year round. \n\nI always get their chicken salad- the citrus, and kale mix is delicious. Also I've had their gyro before, and it's pretty good too. Their fries and potatoes are to die for. To top it off- don't forget to get their frozen yogurt with baklava. Pro tip- split everything with a friend, because I always have leftovers!\n\nWe need Souvla in NYC!",

There's quite a bit of seating, including outdoors with some lights if you're coming with a few friends.\n\nI ordered the chicken salad and split some fries with garlic dipping sauce. Unfortunately, I forgot to ask to remove onions so I didn't really enjoy it. Otherwise it's a very colorful, flavorful salad with a bit of citrus. The texture of the chicken reminds me of carnitas, different than what I was expecting.\n\nThe fries were the best part! Highly recommend the sauce to go along.\n\nOverall I think the place is great but I'll definitely want to try a wrap next time instead.",

      "text": "Came here on a Saturday around 11:30AM and getting a seat was no problem at all. This location seems to be much less busy than the Hayes and Mission locations, which is a plus! They have a front patio and a really cute back patio so you can enjoy the nice weather, as well as normal indoor seating. It seems to be fast casual, so you order at the counter, get a number, and someone will bring the food out to you. \n\nI got to try the lamb salad Greek style (fries on top), roasted potatoes with rotisserie drippings, and a bit of the lamb sandwich. The prices may seem a bit steep but trust me, the portions are huge and they don't skimp on the meat. I felt like half of my salad was lamb! \n\nStandouts of the meal were the Greek fries (especially with the tangy hot sauce) and lamb sandwich. The fries are so crisp and flavorful, and the soft pita bread really compliments the lamb/veggie filling well. \n\nI felt like my salad had a little too much dressing, and while there was a lot of lamb, not every piece of lamb was that good. Some were rather dry so it was a little hit or miss. As for the roasted potatoes, we were really excited to try them but they didn't really seem to have much flavor of their own and were instead just swimming in rotisserie drippings, which made them a little too oily. I think it needed some more salt/spice. \n\nI'll probably be back if I'm in the area!",

      "text": "Out of numerous bookmarked food spots to try in the bay, I was especially excited for this one - namely their Greek froyo. However, being an avid froyo/ice cream lover, my expectations weren't too high. \n\nI ordered the chicken sandwich which was heavily drenched with olive oil. It was kind of a struggle to eat my wrap since it got oily, but I guess that was the point? I also felt like the chicken thigh meat could have been juicier. But my boyfriend enjoyed his lamb sandwich. We also got the roasted potatoes, which was swimming in a pool of olive oil as well. Wasn't bad with their house-made hot sauce though. Although in all honesty, we probably should've gotten the fries instead.\n\nTHUMBS UP for the cute outside patio! Minimalistic design with a cozy feel, while the mini heaters kept us nice and warm amidst the windy SF weather. \n\nLast but not least, that yogurt ... man. Exceeded my expectations without a doubt. Originally I wanted to try the sea salt and olive oil one, but I was kind of sick of olive oil by the end of the meal so I'm glad we went with baklava. The honey crumbs paired PERFECTLY with the tartness of the Greek yogurt. Oh that's money.",

I love both the white sweet potato salad and the chicken salad, though as a meat-eater, I tend to pick the latter more often since I find it slightly more filling. \n\nMy real favorite dishes at Souvla, though, are of course the Greek fries (+a side of Greek yogurt dipping sauce--worth the extra cost) and their baklava-topped Greek froyo. The super sweet baklava pairs so perfectly with the tart froyo base. While Souvla offers other solid variations of their froyo (that I have tried), when given the choice, why would you ever choose an option that DIDN'T come topped with baklava?",

They have iced tea in a bottle, which for SF, is wildly optimistic. Maybe a special now and then? Work with me guys. \n\nThe decor is cute, the meats are juicy (like lean over your tray juicy because I've stained some pants with drippings while I scarfed down my pita.)\nOne day I hope to try the fries and/or frozen yogurt.

But I loved almost everything about this place!\n\nDefinitely a hole in the wall! I guess it's normal, but restaurant is located right underneath a home! AMAZING. This place is definitely aesthetically cute from the inside seating area where you can look out the window to people watch while you eat, to the seating in the backyard looking area. We went when it was sunny weather so sitting outside was AWESOME. \n\nDownsides: Definitely the price. But hey, it's SF right? For just myself I spent around $23 - salad and fries! Not the most cheapest but I loved my salad. The portion was actually really large! Which I surprised about. I even had leftovers. The place is very tight. But that's a given. If you're in a large group, not the funnest place to walk through. But if it's just yourself or a date or something, PERFECT place. It's just such a relaxing place to be at for some reason. \n\nOverall a great experience for me. I don't often go to places like this but this was such a cute hole in the wall kinda place. Very clean, friendly staff, and relaxing place to be at. If you have room in your belly for some yogurt, don't forget to try it with Baklava. I don't like Baklava much, but theirs is frikkin delicious! Their meat - I got lamb - was so tasty and I felt so healthy and good eating it in a salad form (: Their garlic fries are also really good, but I think I could've lived without them lol. BUT their ranch was actually the topper. I don't know what ranch I got, but it's definitely not normal ranch lol. SO GOOD!",

      "text": "Souvla is such a talked about San Francisco institution that I'm a bit embarrassed to say that I hadn't tried it out until now. My friend and I hit this location up on a weekday for lunch and were pleasantly surprised to find that it has a gorgeous back patio! The weather was a mix of chilly and sunny so we opted to sit outside and enjoy the greenery and sunshine. So in terms of leaf eater options, there's only really the sweet potato or other sides. I went with a roasted sweet potato sandwich and opted to grab some Greek fries on the side as well. So full disclosure, I actually do not like sweet potato very much. However, I always feel like I should give it a chance because you can prepare it so many different ways and maybe one way will click with my palate. Unfortunately, the sweet potato at Souvla was more on the sweet side than I'd like. I found it hard to finish my sandwich because I couldn't get past how sweet the overall taste was. If you like sweet potato, you will most likely love this sandwich and appreciate it wholeheartedly. If you're a sweet potato avoider like me, you may want to skip it. \n\nYou may be wondering at this point how I could rate this place a 4.0 when I didn't even like the sandwich. Well you see, there's nothing I love more in this world than french fries, especially if they are done amazingly well. Souvla KILLED it in terms of having some of the best fries I have ever had. They were crispy, flavorful, and delicious without being too oily. They're also served with a dip (you can choose from a list) and my friend and I chose the garlic one which was an amazing decision.  \n\nMy friend ordered the lamb sandwich and juicy potatoes. If you a strict vegetarian, keep in mind that these potatoes sit under the meat and are covered in the rotisserie drippings. Because of this, I didn't eat the potatoes. However, my friend did tell me that they were good, but not as good as the fries.\n\nService was great when we ordered and my overall experience was great, minus the sweet potato. I am definitely going back for those fries and will most likely grab some yogurt on my next trip.",

This is the third location I have visited in the city (first in Hayes Valley, then on Valencia), and I can say this one is just as fabulous as the rest. \n\nOLIVE OIL AND SEA SALT FROZEN GREEK YOGURT. You can't go wrong with any of their creative frozen Greek yogurt selections, but this one happens to be my favorite! The richness and subtle sweetness of the olive oil really compliments the contrasting salt and creaminess of the yogurt. The Baklava and Honey Syrup flavor is my second favorite.  Must try!\n\nAlso, this location is so close to Alamo Square Park, so it is the perfect stop to grab a treat to enjoy when viewing the Painted Ladies!",

      "text": "Souvla nails fast casual Greek food and the new location on Divis is dangerously convenient for me. All the spit fired meats are tender plus the combinations of citrus fruits and pickled vegetables balance out so nicely. I actually wish they added more pickled vegetables into their sandwiches. The lamb is amazing and if they ask how you want your fries, have them directly in the sandwich itself. I like baklava and the yogurt version is refreshingly indulgent. My husband doesn't care for Greek yogurt normally but can't stop eating Souvla's tart frozen yogurt.",

The salad was filling with sweet potato slices and a mix of butter lettuce/kale. Yum. We couldn't resist ordering the fries, which were effing delicious. One order is great for 2 to share. \n\nWe were too full for dessert so we went to the concert down the street. Luckily, the band was running late so we agreed on going back to Souvla for fro-yo. I got the baklava crumble. Hubby got the olive oil and sea salt. Tasty, big portions.\n\nNo reservations, easy communal seating. Friendly, fast service.",

      "text": "Souvla is a casual, modern, counter-service Greek restaurant with a simple menu centered around sandwiches and salads with spit-fired meats. They also offer a couple sides, a surprising selection of Greek wines, and of course, frozen Greek yogurt!\n\nI came here for lunch on a Sunday, and the one issue we had when entering the small restaurant was the noise--it was fairly difficult to find a good place to sit that made it easy to talk, and the tall chairs weren't very comfortable. The food, however, was definitely quality and on-point. I got to try the lamb sandwich, which was cubes of lamb leg wrapped in pita with a yogurt sauce, feta cheese, and pickled vegetables. The lamb reminded me of gyro and was tasty, and the meat-to-everything-else ratio was definitely generous. The avgolemono soup, made with rice, chicken, egg, and lemon was nice as well--definitely strong on the lemony flavor, but a little expensive for what it was. Finally, I got to try the chicken salad, which was my favorite. The chicken was so juicy and succulent, and the salad (which included fennel, kale, onion, orange) was simple and tasty--it went perfectly with the olive oil and the yogurt-based dressings.\n\nFinally, we had to get the frozen Greek yogurt--we tried the sour cherry syrup, the greek olive oil & sea salt, and the baklava crumble, and each of these was delicious. The yogurt itself was light yet creamy and balanced between sweet/sour, and each of the different toppings played together very nicely with the yogurt. Overall, this is a great restaurant for a casual, light lunch, but all of the items are definitely expensive for what you get, and the atmosphere could definitely be improved and made more comfortable.",

      "text": "Can't wait to go back to Souvla again soon! I had such a great dinner with some girlfriends this week. I love that they source their meat from providers who care about animal welfare and sustainable farming practices. It might mean things are slightly more expensive, but the quality is so high and the flavor is incredible. \n\nI ordered the chicken salad---I almost NEVER order a salad because...salad. But after seeing pictures of this one on Yelp I felt it could be worth it as long as I got a side of fries with it. Both were amazing. The salad was bright, flavorful, and the chicken was so tender and juicy. I loved the fennel with orange as well. I have a hard time envisioning this one in gyro form, but for a salad it was awesome. Same for the fries, they were really flavorful and perfectly crispy. \n\nCouldn't leave without getting a frozen greek yogurt. I asked the server what his favorite was and he recommended cherry with sea salt. Such a good pro tip! The salt really cuts the richness as does the tart cherry sauce. I loved it!\n\nThe atmosphere was warm, casual and comfortable. We sat in the front by the rotisseries and it was perfect to catch up with friends. Next time I'll be more patient and wait for the patio in the back because that looked really nice!",

Perfect for all occasions, breakfast/lunch/dinner/snack/etc. Nothing better than chomping into a lamb salad with fries on an empty stomach, fills me all the way up. Going for the sandwich is just as good because that pita is DELICIOUS.\n\nOnly thing not getting it to a 5 is occasional inconsistency of the meal, sometimes overdressed / underdressed but really who can complain that much.

The back seating area is outdoors, but even on a cooler night in San Francisco (the kind that Mark Twain raved about) it was toasty, cozy, and well-lit due to the heat lamps and well-placed light fixtures. We sat at the bar seating on the upper level. Seating there is a little tight, but not uncomfortable.\n\nAs to the food, you won't be disappointed. We both had the lamb wrap, which had remarkably tender, juicy meat while not making a gigantic mess of the wrap. Admittedly quite the feat. Afterward we had the Greek yogurt with the baklava and honey on top. Would _highly_ recommend getting this. Recently went by on an afternoon stroll to get the yogurt again, and the cold, slightly sour yogurt combined with the sweet, light crunch of the baklava was as fantastic as I had remembered it.\n\nOn top of that, reasonable prices all around! Keep in mind, this place gets pretty busy on the weekends, but there are also three locations, so you can perhaps check around if you're so inclined. More importantly, if you're meeting someone make sure you specify which address!",

Like the total mix of flavors and sauces in the chicken gyro are solid, but the chicken itself is a bit dry and grainy and at $13 you should be getting some moister chicken. I'm not a fan of white meat generally but you can give it a little more moisture by throwing some drippings back in there. For the old heads, there's an SNL sketch about \"the juice\" which fits this well.",

Souvla is fine-casual so you order at the register, you're given a number, you seat yourself, and the food is brought out to you. \n\nSpeaking of food, the Greek fries are delicious! They are crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. I love the tang and brightness from the cheese and lemon. The fries come with a dipping sauce of your choice, extra sauce costs extra. \n\nThe sandwiches are delicious...and huge. My husband and I couldn't finish our own sandwiches; we could have split one. He really liked his chicken sandwich and I thought the lamb was tender and flavorful. The avgolemono could have been more lemony, IMHO. \n\nTheir greek frozen yogurt is good, too. Not too sweet, has a bit of tang. If you get the olive oil & sea salt, which I liked, make sure to stir it up to avoid getting a mouthful of salt all at once. \n\nOverall, yummy food, chill atmosphere, good service. I'll be back.",

Each bite was packed with flavor-- I couldn't get enough. \n\nMy friend ordered the lamb sandwich which she described as decent. The lamb was a bit tough; however, she and I agree that the fries were PHENOMENAL. Not too soft, not too crunchy, these babies were the perfect fry. \n\nAs for the ambient: super trendy and modern.

My current favorite is the roast chicken without cheese and dressing on the side. I usually toss in the olive oil and forgo the yogurt, and the result is absolutely perfect! Although this is my favorite, you cannot go wrong with any salad. The fries are pretty tasty and I have not yet tried the roasted potatoes.

We love the chicken wrap and even the salad is super good for when you wanna be \"healthy\" lol. It is a bit pricey I will say, $13-15 for your entree and then $4-$5 for frozen yogurt but you can definitely taste the quality so in my opinion, worth!

      "text": "Came here last night for a friend's birthday dinner. My observations and impressions are as follows:\n\nPatio:\n\nThe patio set up is nice and can accommodate a group of up to 8 or 9. There are two high top tables with three to four chairs each. There is also a little bar with some stools that can fit up to three. \n\nFood: \n\nThe veg salad is amazing. I added lamb to it and it was a show stopper. The lettuce remained crisp despite the warm sweet potato and toasty lamb pieces (I hope your mouth is watering).  There were so many fun surprises in the salad including walnuts, olives and feta cheese. \n\nLibations:\n\nI guzzled up my house red wine - it was delectable.  My friends greatly enjoyed the rosé.  You can either get a large 250 mL, 500 mL or a bottle. \n\nDessert:\n\n'Cause let's be honest, this is what we have all been waiting for- the greek yogurt with house baklava is phenomenal. My mouth was overwhelmed by this level of pure deliciousness. A solid mix of slightly tart greek frozen yogurt (consistency of soft serve) and a warm sticky muddled blend of baklava. My heart is content...for now.\n\nStop by if you haven't yet and get your Greek on!",

We were a group of 4 so I wouldn't expect to have issues, but it was too cold outside and the only availability inside was a bar style seating in a line so that we couldn't really catch up and talk very easily. Other than that, it was a great meal!",

      "text": "I do not understand the hype around this place at. all.  The food preparation is below decent Greek for a much hyped gyro. We tried both the lamb and chicken (tasteless) gyros. It is incredibly dry, all meat and the pita is not particularly fresh.  Both were difficult to eat. A gyro is supposed to have the food wrapped by soft, fresh pita. These were overstuffed with just dry meat in a stiff unfresh pita. It was $13-15 for a below decent gyro. I'm wondering if I caught them at an off time or day because my experience was nothing like the other reviews.\n\nI did enjoy the Greek lager, which is a not overly light lager with strong honey flavor. I also found the service to be great.\n\nI don't know why but almost all the Greek food I have had in the Bay has been very disappointing!",

I think it would be good in some kind of mixed drink to temper it. Alas--they're model is simple, minimal variety so no retsina sangria I bet.\n\nThe frozen yogurt is tangy and refreshing but the sour cherry syrup isn't sour cherry---it's regular cherry flavor. If you grew up with sour cherry and can tell the difference you'll care, if you didn't you probably won't mind.\n\nThe back patio of the Divis location is really lovely, especially when it's not crowded.\n\nDoes anyone know if there's gluten in the lamb salad (or somewhere else in the salads or proteins)? Maybe soy in the marinade?",

The Divis location definitely skimped out on portion size compared to the Hayes Valley location, and with the amount of time spent waiting for a salad and the increasing prices, it's come to my realization that Souvla is now being put on my \"if someone else is paying\" list.\n\nDon't get me wrong. The food is still good, but I just can't bring it to myself to recommend Souvla to friends if the bang-for-buck value isn't there. At the end of the day, it's a very simple recipe (chicken salad is just strips of chicken + greens + red onion + some fruit in greek yogurt/olive oil dressing) that you can recreate for a fraction of the cost.",

Not greasy. We ordered one and needed another one!!\n\nThe second order we made of the side of fries the consistency was not the same! The also messed up our order.\n\nThey weren't as crisp and the seasoning over the fries were not the same? \n\nWe found it a bit odd since we literally ordered the fries right after we got our order...so why was it not consistent? Not to mention the guy who brought us our order literally brought us plain fries with no salt. Our order was Greek fries and no salt on the fries itself, keep everything else. Not sure how they managed to mess that up when on the receipt all it said was \"no salt\" lol.\n\nHe was not happy about it when we said what happened to the fries as they're suppose to have everything on it except for the salt. He said \"the cheese has salt\". Well obviously? But I never said I didn't want cheese?! Anyways so he brought it back to us after he seasoned it with the cheese, olive oil, lemon juice and parsley. Still wasn't the same.\n\nSeems like the overall mix of the seasoning was missing this time around and not as good as the first one we got which is silly, they need to fix their consistency!\n\nThey don't have ketchup at the tables and don't offer that as well, only hot sauce. Sauce with the fries are an extra $1. We got the \"granch\" Greek yoghurt ranch sauce. The sauce was great! Perfect balance of spices to the Greek yogurt. \n\nSauce was overpriced for a little spoonful of sauce, should be included with the meal or $0.50 instead. \n\nOverall I would come back for the sandwich gyros and the fries, even though there was a consistency issue on the fries, I would try this again if I'm in the area!",

      "text": "May I dare say this is more 3.5 star rounded to 4. \n\nI came here on a new year's afternoon at about 2.30pm after attempts to visit Brenda's Soul Food & Brenda's Meat and Three did not work out (huge queues outside both restaurants scared me off). \n\nThere was a long line to order at Souvla's but the line moved quickly. It was also easy to get a table after ordering. Food came really quickly, which was a plus. \n\nUnfortunately, with my expectations bolstered by the overall 4.5 yelp rating, I thought that the food was just average. \n\nLamb sandwich - Hmm more of a burrito. Lamb was tougher and dryer than I would have liked. Again with the rating I expected a melt in your mouth, more-ish sort of dish but it fell abit short. \n\nLamb salad - quite pricey at $14 but it was a huge bowl. Not authentic Greek but I guess it's modified to suit San Franciscan tastes (they promise to use local produce after all). For kale lovers.\n\nGreek fries - crisp thick-cut fries which are above average but not the best I've had in the city. \n\nAlthough the food was a tad disappointing, the place was furnished tastefully, lots of white and wood, like how I would want my home to look like. So 4 stars it is.",

They've since expanded and Souvla has become one of my go-to staples for a casual meal when I'm feeling too lazy to make my own. The Divisadero location is less crowded than Hayes or Mission. There's a spacious outdoor patio area in the back as well if you like dine outside.\n\nWhile the chicken is on the dry side, the lamb items are on point! My lamb salad was very flavorful and tender. For fast food, the ingredients are fresh, the flavor profile has depth. The cucumber, radish, and sprouts bring out a freshness that outbalances the heaviness of the lamb. I also enjoyed the harissa spiked yogurt dressing which brought an element of tang to round it out.\n\nFor dessert, the olive oil salted frozen greek yogurt is an interesting sweet and savory treat!",

      "text": "My favorite not-upscale restaurant in San Francisco. I could eat here everyday for the rest of my life. I try to bring all of my visitors here - all have loved it as much as I do.\n\nMust Try: The Lamb Salad\nThis is my favorite salad in the entire world. It's the only salad I crave drunkenly - I usually want to drunk eat pizza, tacos, etc., but this is just that good. If you eat meat, even if you're not usually a lamb person, you need to try this salad. The dressing (just the right level of creamy), kale, pickled onions, cheese and perfect sized slices of perfectly grilled lamb combine to create the most incredible taste experience. I also think that for $14, while not cheap, you're getting a great deal for San Francisco. This salad, which is super generous with the lamb and depending on how hungry you are could be 1 or 2 meals, would be like $25 at Blue Barn. \n\nOther awesome food:\n*The fries are GREAT. Recommend sharing with a friend.\n*The frozen greek yogurt is delicious, especially with the baklava and honey. I always lament the fact that I don't have the appetite to get one after finishing my salad. Worth a trip just for this as a snack.\n*The breakfast sandwich, offered until 2pm on weekends, is SO GOOD. I tried it with the lamb that I love so much and was so excited about how good it tasted. \n\nThings to note:\n*The Divis location has a lovely patio with heat lamps.\n*The line moves pretty quickly.\n*You can order wine here in several different sizes - the 500mL is perfect for when you're sharing with a friend but don't quite want an entire bottle.\n*If you're with more than like 4 people, it might be tough to find seating.\n*Sometimes they offer a brined whole chicken that serves ~4 people. I really want to try this if I can ever peel myself away from the lamb salad for just an evening.\n*Have I mentioned that I'm obsessed with this place?",

I frequently feel like I don't get served enough meat, but with all the fixings it was hard finishing it and I felt super satisfied. The lamb was delicious, well seasoned. I tried a few of the fries. They had some light seasoning and light cheese which was nice. Sometimes dressed fries are just too over the top. They were crispy but still soft inside. My favorite was probably the frozen yogurt. Soo good. I would go back just for that. Very rich and tart. Reminds me of froyo from my hometown in Mexico. I wasn't crazy about the baklava topping. It was very soft and sweet, I'll try other options next time!",

There is a nice outdoor patio in the back with seating. I was even surprised that we were able to get seats after waiting in line to order for 15 minutes. This is a counter service restaurant where you order and pay up front, then wait for available seats while they bring your food.\n\nThe two things that keep this from a 5 star review are the service, and the counter service checkout tipping options. I am not a fan of tipping with options of 15%, 20% and 25% before I receive any service. I will happily tip well when I get great service, but I didn't get to judge that before tipping. Also, the service was barely ok. We had to ask for several things and we were quickly served and then discarded. When we asked for hot sauce, a server came over, then snatched a bottle of an adjacent table without a word, then walked away. We had to apologize to the other table on behalf of the rude server. \n\nOn to the good. The food was excellent. The small greek salad was a very tasty appetizer, the fries were crisp and fluffy on the inside. I recommend the garlic dipping sauce for the fries. They offer 4 options if I remember correctly. Also, save room for their greek frozen yogurt. It was a wonderful combination of sweet and tangy. I ordered the option with baklava crumbles, but found it to be a little on the sweet side. I would try a different option next time, but I absolutely wouldn't miss out on this treat.",

The provider of this meat was probably the oldest \"lamb\" in mutton history. The taste and texture reminded me of trying to eat a spoonful of carrot pulp from a juicer.

Also, the service was great because I got my food in a short amount of time despite how packed it was. The woman taking my order was very patient and willing to answer any questions I had about the menu which was highly appreciated.\n\nThe restaurant has a lot of seating. They even have a cute patio area in the back of the restaurant if the indoor seating is full. There is no parking lot so be prepared to park on the street.

I loved the sweetness of the red onions and the creaminess of the cheese in this salad- all the flavors blended really well and if I go back to Souvla, this would be my go-to salad pick\n\nLamb salad (4/5): this salad was up there but compared to the pork, I think the lamb was a bit tougher and not as tender/juicy. I got a bit tired of chewing after a while and some bits of the lamb were dryer and less flavorful. Overall still a yummy salad that really fills you up though.",

(Granted, none of them are on Divisadero.) I'm guessing these people account for most of the positive reviews.\n\nThe food was fine, but has nothing to do with Greek or Mediterranean cuisine. Tzatziki sauce? This \"Greek\" restaurant called \"Souvla\" has apparently never heard of it. This is typical California \"fusion\", novel but I wouldn't call it delicious, especially to those of us familiar with actual Greek cuisine. And certainly not worth anything like what they charge for it. Everything on the menu is about priced about 40% higher than it should be. If the prices weren't exorbitant it could be a 4-star place, but at $13 for a salad, no way. \n\nI had heard the fries were great. It's not true. They're nothing special.\n\nThe food isn't awful, but considering the prices, I see no reason to ever come back here.",

      "text": "I'm completely obsessed with Souvla - such a cozy spot for Mediterranean food that's simple, but refined. I understand the perpetual line out the door. This eatery is ideal for those who prefer limited menu choices - you pick your favorite protein option (which comes with a set selection of gourmet accompaniments) and choose between a salad or wrap. My generous portion of rotisserie chicken lay on a bed of lettuce, kale, orange slices, pickled red onions a crumbly white cheese, and a lemony homemade dressing. \n\nCheers to Nico M. for showing me this amazing spot! It's so hard to find healthy food options that are also affordable and tasty. Souvla pleases all palettes, with other options like Greek fries, sweet potato, pork shoulder, and lamb! I would LOVE to see Souvla come to Los Angeles! We ended our dinner by splitting the Greek yogurt soft serve topped with a sour cherry syrup. The froyo is refreshing and not overly sweet - next time I visit I want to try a yogurt topped with crumbled baklava and honey.",

      "text": "Souvla has been on my list for a long time coming - but it didn't live up to my expectations.\n\nService: 5 stars\nFast casual. Friendly cashiers, extremely fast service. Sat down for 2 minutes and my salad already arrived! Love that you can order your fro-yo as you order your food and then come back to pick it up when you're ready without having to stand in line again.\n\nOverall feel and cleanliness of the restaurant: 5 stars\nBback patio area is so cute - and heated!! V important. Nice and casual place to catch up with a friend, not recommended for big groups. Communal seating, servers constantly busy clearing tables and serving food. Kept very clean!\n\nFood:\nChicken Salad: 3 stars\n(*Review is mostly for chicken salad, haven't tried the other salads or any of the sandwiches yet)\nPortion was generous. It's fair for the cost and you get A LOT of chicken. I had like a good 1/4 of a chicken thigh leftover in my bowl - and I had a bite of chicken in each forkful! It certainly looked beautiful - but it fell short on flavor for me! The chicken was a bit dry, and I felt like there wasn't enough dressing in the salad - I'm the type that usually goes for light dressing too. So, if you like your salads with more dressing, you should ask for it. The topping to salad green ratio was good, I got a little bit of everything (greens + pickled onions + orange + chicken) for every bite, but overall, I felt like the chicken was... just OK. Not enough flavor for me. Maybe my downfall was just not asking for more dressing, it probably would have saved the salad! Next time. I would certainly return to give it another try!\n\nFroyo: 4 stars\nI asked for baklava with a bit of salt. The light syrup drizzle was REALLY good, just lightly sweet and on the watery end - a good complement to the tart froyo. Very smooth and not TOO sour. A nice light and cool dessert to the end of a meal. For baklava, I usually anticipate something more crunchy (hello, phyllo dough!) but this was more on the doughy and heavy side? I think it went well with the froyo though.",

And Souvla delivers every time. Find yourself a table, order a salad, Greek fries + housemade \"granch\" dressing to share along with a few mugs of the Greek table wine for good measure. On your way out, pick up some fro-yo to go - you can't go wrong with any of the flavors, but the sour cherry is my go to.",

I can't say enough good things about Souvla, the brainchild of the famous Kokkari and Evvia restauranteurs. \n\nYou pick between 4 proteins - lamb, pork shoulder, rotisserie chicken, and sweet potato. You can have them as salads or as a gyro. I'm a huge fan of the lamb gyro and the chicken salad. Their fries and potatoes are delicious, and you can opt to get them in the wrap \"Greek-style\" for 50c more!\n\nTheir frozen yogurt has spoiled me from all other fro-yo places, so make sure you get those as dessert before you leave.

Definitely a step up from the lamb salad experience I had at Souvla on Hayes. The lamb here were in visible cubes rather than shredded dry bits. \n\nThis location is larger with a sweet patio in the back. There is a large family table, some bar setting and high 2 person high tables along the back. Beware if you sit under the tree, there are many ants that occasionally fall from the trees. Great place to sit if you enjoy the extra protein in your salad and your hair. \n\nOverall: \nFood/ drinks: 5/5 for salad bowls. \n\nService: 3/5 - hard to rate service for a place that has no service. Everything is self serve here. The pro about this location is that we didn't feel rushed to leave. \n\nEnvironment: 4/5- great decor, free wifi and self seating, self water service, clean the tables yourself, however music is still a little louder than what's comfortable to have a conversation in.",

It's fast and casual but still delicious and you can order wine and hangout for a while if you feel like it. I usually go for the chicken salad, but I've also had the chicken wrap and the lamb salad (definitely add fries to your salad). The Greek fries are really good too. My favorite froyo is the one with baklava, it's the perfect consistency and the toppings are in the perfect amount. Combined with the reasonable pricing, it's definitely a favorite of mine!",

There is also outside seating but it was a bit too chilly for us to sit outside. I got the lamb sandwich which was so yummy. You must order it with fries inside- it really gives it that extra punch. Lamb was pretty tender. My only complaint was that the bread was a bit flater than I would have preferred and all the fillings were bunched up and not spread out well.\n\nThe avgolemono soup was pretty good! Strong on the lemony side- a greek version of chicken soup. Finally the baklava yogurt was so good! The yogurt is quite tart- as is expected, but the baklava inside was delicious!\n\nOverall- pretty good place and would definitely come back.",

Souvla sets the standard by which all of these \"fancy fast food\" places popping up on Divis or other gentrified SF drags should be judged.\n\nYou may have to wait in line for a few minutes to get your order in, but after that the food comes out shockingly quickly. \n\nThe kitchen here is a finely tuned machine, and this is reflected in the core ingredients of Souvla's menu (spit roasted lamb, pork and chicken). The meats are well seasoned, tender from slow roasting and juicy. \n\nYou can't go wrong with any of the salads or wraps, but personal favorites are the pork salad, fries+harissa yogurt, and the dank level infinity \"juicy potatoes\".

I was quite surprised about this, didn't want to believe they were little teeth marks on the pitas. My husband and I finished the salad but didn't eat the pitas.

      "text": "I asked a local if there were any good and reasonably priced places to eat in the area, and was given Souvla as a recommendation. Upon arriving to the restaurant, I could tell the food must be delicious, as there were people seated at just about every place at every table. The restaurant itself is bright, and airy. It gives off a cozy feeling, with its relaxed colors and cleanliness. The rotisserie near the kitchen lets you know that the meat is freshly and hot, just waiting to be ordered. The cashier was attentive, friendly, and helpful in navigating the menu. I ordered the Chicken salad togo. The box was a chic design, and I didn't even have to ask for utensils. About the salad. The ingredients (what I can remember), fennel, orange sections, kale, romaine, a salty cheese (if you know spaghetti factories pasta and cheese dish-its that cheese), rotisserie chicken, pickled red onions, and dressing. The presentation wasn't the best, be the flavor was a 9/10. I only say this because, the chicken looked a bit, how do I say this nicely?...a bit already chewed. If it were sliced, it would be a lot more appetizing to look at. While eating the salad, I was thinking about how the orange slices sort of look thrown in. I'm sure there is another way to add the oranges (because they did add a sweetness I enjoyed-that I don't usually see in greek savory dishes) to a salad in a more unique way. Oh, and the red onions were a bit tart, as if they had been sitting out for some time. I would definitely like to try this salad again with fresher prepared pickled onions. When done right, they are my fav. Lastly, in my opinion the dressing and cheese should come in separate containers (small enough to fit in the sleek box) for togo orders, for obvious reasons (more time to travel with it before the dressing wilts the lettuce). \n\nOverall, flavor packed! \n\nAnd, Ik some people might disagree with me being so picky about presentation. But other than food being a nutritious meal to keep me energized throughout my day, its also an experience to savor in every aspect there is. So, picky yes, is it warranted? Why not?\n\nWould I recommend this place? Yes. Buon appetito. Was that Greek? Probably not. Lol",

All of the proteins are thoughtfully sourced, so you can eat them with a good conscience. Also, don't forget their amazing frozen greek yogurt dessert.

We stopped here around 8:30pm on a Tuesday night at had no issues finding a spot to sit. Both ordered the veggie salad with sweet potato and it is the BOMB. The white sweet potato is incredibly creamy and the olive oil dressing is light and tangy.The salad itself is huge so definitely enough to take home for lunch the next day.\n\nThe all-star favorite? Greek yogurt. The employees are really chill about mixing and matching flavors, so I'm a huge fan of the olive oil and sea salt w/ a slice of baklava. I need to look into the cost of getting a Souvla Greek yogurt machine installed in my apartment so that I can binge eat this stuff every day.",

So delicious and such a perfect little afternoon snack and appetizer to the yogurt! \n\nThe back patio is quiet and gorgeous!

It was presented beautifully, but kale needs some love before serving in a salad, so the texture was what one would expect with huge chunks of dry kale. \n\nI'd go back for fries and maybe to try their frozen yogurt. Again, kind people and amazing service. Just not my preferred style of Greek/Mediterranean.",

Instead, they are serving the exact same limited menu as Hayes, nothing new. \nThe dining room is also the same, small cramped tables and communal seating. No intimidate dining experience to be had. The kitchen while overly large, detracts from the dining experience. Just like Hayes, I'd prefer to take away. \nAnd don't order your wine in metal cups, it adds a metallic taste in your wine. \nHopeful they'll make necessary changes as their business evolves.",

Everything was always tasty, but just didn't call to me like it seems to call to everyone else. \n\nThat all changed after I got a lamb salad to go. \n\nFor $1 more (I felt a little silly paying more for a salad than for a sandwich, is that just me?) you get what feels like a lot more meat than comes in the sandwich. And I think that the flavors of the cheese, dressing, radishes, and onions are way stronger and more complementary when they're not disguised by the bread. The salad is just a superior dish all around. \n\nIt's a really hefty portion; enough to split in half and eat for lunch and dinner for me.",

      "text": "i don't know what happened to souvla, with its original location being so successful in hayes valley, it's only exciting to try out the newer location on divisadero. however it was a let down.\n\nthere are 2 major things that went wrong with our recent experience. we can in for togo orders for lamb salad and chicken gyro sandwich.\n\n1. food: lamb salad was monotone when it comes to flavor. the only one note was \"tangy\" from all the pickled onions and dressing without good balance of other flavors in there, it would've been better to have a few sweet elements in there (for example, some pomegranate seeds to balance it out) . the lamb was also dry. chicken gyro was a disaster. albeit having more sweet elements in there, the shredded chicken was really dry. but the interesting part was the disturbingly huge amount of chicken fat that was dripping out from the bottom of the gyro into the box when we're eating it. still couldn't get our heads wrapped around how the chicken could be so dry to taste but massive amount of chicken grease was escaping from the other end. it was unappetizing.\n\n2. safety: the chicken gyro had a thin wish bone left in there. in the midst of eating, my partner pulled out a long, roughly 2 inch long thin chicken bone that was left in the shredded meat. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. can you imagine if he had swallowed the bone and it lodged in his throat? this is purely bad quality control on the restaurant's end and you really NEED TO be more thorough with deboning and shredding your meats. SCARY!\n\nall in all, it was such a let down, would've given a 1 star, but another star goes to the friendly service staff with smiles on their faces. all in all, horrible food and will not return to to location.",

After just one visit we're eager to come back to try different menu items. This time we tried the chicken gyro sandwich, Greek fries and the white sweet potato salad. We shared our orders and we couldn't be happier. The salad was generously portioned and very fresh, offering a distinct flavor from typical salads found elsewhere in the area. The chicken gyro sandwich was very fresh and delicious, also generously portioned with plenty of tender chicken breast meat in it. The fries were also really good, nice and crispy and seasoned very well. \nWe came at a good time, relatively early so tables were readily available, although we noticed the place filled up fast. There's outdoor seating out front and in the back, which was really nice. I enjoyed being able to get my own flask of water without having to bother the staff with it. Overall great atmosphere, friendly staff and our food arrived very quickly. \nWe're glad we decided to be adventurous today, it paid off in spades and we will definitely be back.",

Besides the yummy sweet potatoes, their dressing is soo good, I will have to try to look of the recipe and make it myself because this place is far from where I live. There is also kale and pickled onions and other stuff. Their salad portion is big, you will leave full/ satisfied if you order one. A must try! I'll have to try the other salads next time.

We decided to cater our summer backyard party over Labor Day with build your own chicken and lamb sandwiches or salads.  Yum, right? Well, the heat wave hit SF on Friday and two of the 3 Souvla walk ins fridges went down on Saturday. They had to close all 3 stores due to power outages and workers' heat exhaustion.  But Charles, Tony & Lauren still made our catering order happen - coming in especially to fulfill our order for 30 people. It was a smash hit! I would recommend using Souvla's catering - they are a great team to work with. Or just stop by and have a fantastic roasted meat salad or sandwich!!",

I had their chicken salad and I can't say enough good things about it except the portion size may be a tad to large! j/k on the size, but this could easily be shared and paired with another dish-- the lamb sandwich (on flat bread) would be perfect. The beer in blue bottles is palatable but, after the uber-hoppy stuff you find around town these days, takes some time to get used to. it's tough to find a seat, so be creative and friendly and mosey on up to any available space-- I'm sure they'll understand. Only really bummer is I'm going to gain weight because of this place.",

Order food at the counter they give you a number and bring food quickly. I had the Greek soup lemony, shredded chicken with rice. Very good, flavors all worked well together. Also ate the vegetarian salad with kale, romaine, walnuts, good dressing. Had a Greek cheese shredded not feta. It was good too. For dessert we had Greek yogurt sundae. The flavor of the yogurt was very tangy, quite nice. It had crumbled baklava, I did not like that. Food was reasonably priced, soup $6, salad $11. If I was in that area again I would like to try other things on the menu.",

The soft serve yogurt with honey, baklava or sour cherry is BOMB and a light refreshing dessert to end your meal. It's fast too. You order at the counter and get your meal within 5 minutes.

      "text": "Inconsistent. I've had amazing food from here, and I've also had very mediocre food. However, lately it's been trending more towards mediocre/poor. Used to always get wraps, and over the past few months started getting the whole rotisserie chickens. The chickens were fantastic for the first five I got. The last four have been either dried out, burned, the last one I had was bloody. As far as the wraps go the meat is so inconsistent, but as of late just dried out, smaller portions. Sometimes you get harissa yogurt, sometimes you don't. Sometimes the meat is moist, sometimes it's just swimming in a boatload of oil. I truly just think they've expanded too rapidly and they don't have enough oversight in the kitchens when they get busy. It's just guys literally throwing things together without any care or consideration for the final product. I normally don't review, but after spending 30+ dollars on two wraps that were skimpy on everything, and the meat was completely dried out, I can't justify returning. Truly disappointing because I used to love the place, however every time I go in now it's a gamble whether you get a good product or not. Never really write reviews and I work in the industry but just had to express my displeasure. I have even mentioned the inconsistency issues with the chef, and he seemed very concerned. However being concerned is one thing, and actually practicing what you preach is another. I'm sure they will continue to be incredibly successful because most people don't really care, but you should save your money and go elsewhere. For the same money you can get amazing food from ragazza or namu stonepot. Also just realized my lamb sandwich didn't even have any of the pickled onions on it last night, there's like five ingredients in the sandwich. The fact that they're missing one of them is a pretty big mistake. I hope they can get their act together and maybe I'll try it again in the future.",

I chalk this up to the fact that I really do not like overwhelming amounts of fat in my meat, which I think some people do.  This isn't a sarcastic comment - I know people do.  I even read another comment which talked about how they LOVE the fattiness of the pork.  I, however, prefer actual meat. Further, the prices are a bit steep.  Tonight I ordered a salad for me, sandwich for my husband and side of fries and it was $35.  Yikes.  That said, because I really want to love it....I think I will give it one more try and try the chicken.  I do love the frozen yogurt and they give you a big portion with yummmmmy olive oil and salt.",

I've moved closer to the Nopa location, so I walked over and ordered the Chicken Salad (my favorite!) to go. \nThey brought me my order promptly... they were about to close, so I'm guessing he kitchen was working hard to get orders out quick. I do appreciate the speedy turnaround, and said so to the guy who delivered my food. But when I looked down at the box, and it was marked \"lamb sandwich\"... so I stopped the guy who gave it to me and told him I thought it was the wrong order. He told me, \"no, that's a chicken salad, we just reused the box.\" Um, okay? The box honestly looked a little dinged up, and in hindsight, I wish I'd asked for a fresh one. But, I took out my reuse-able bag and charged onward. \nI think they've changed their recipe for the yogurt dressing to be less yogurt and more olive oil. By the time I got to eat my salad, it tasted far more bland than I remember... of course, that may be because by the time I'd walked the few blocks back home, the gently used box had come apart at the seams and my dinner was pouring out of the box into a pool of olive oil in my bag. \nThe whole experience was disappointing. I used to really like that place. Please don't cut corners on that delicious yogurt dressing. Please only use boxes once. \nI'm still giving 2 stars bc I like that they use organic chicken. (They still do, right?)",

After walking in and seeing a line of people waiting to order, I cringed.  As I passed the line to the pick up area, I spotted Joe and he helped me right away. The chicken was not quite ready but Joe offered to call me when it was ready, cared that I can get a parking ticket, and eventually just brought it out to my car. Even asked if I needed help getting out of the tight parking job I was in! Now I don't expect this above and beyond service from anywhere but when you get it and in times when it counts, man it feels great-I just have to give him a shout out!! Thanks JOE!!!

Nice outdoor seating area both in front on the sidewalk as well as in the back patio (although it was closed when we went because they were installing heat lamps). The inside has some large communal tables in the front and some 4-person high tops along a narrow hallway towards the back. Menu is more or less the same as the Hayes place. Try the lamb wrap, fries and garlicky Greek yogurt dressing. And don't forget the Greek froyo for dessert! My only complaint is that we (a group of 4) had to stand around for 10-15 minutes waiting for a table after placing our order, and there were several groups of 2 lingering at the 4-person tables long after their plates had been cleared. On the flip side, service is fast - our orders were ready while we were still standing and waiting for a table! In short, I'd definitely come back here for a date night or get-together with friends, although I might come at an off-hour to avoid the dinner rush.",
